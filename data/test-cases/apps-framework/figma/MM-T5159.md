## MM-T5159: Create a subscription

---

**Step 1**

1\. From Mattermost type /figma subscribe command\
2\. Get you team id from figma link. To do so, go to figma and select your team from team list. Then you will see the link (example: https\://www\.figma.com/files/team/1092747651363635221). The last parameter of the link is team id.\
3\. Paste the team id into team id field. The webhook selector should have "Create new team webhook" selected.\
4\. Choose any project.\
5\. If you want to make a file subscription choose any file from a file list. If you want to make subscription for all projects, choose "All projects" in file list selector.\
6\. Receive a message that your subscription is successfully created\
7\. Write any comment in figma file from selected project and receive a notification.

**Expected**

On 1. You can use this command only in channels\
On 3. After first subscribe command, run subscribe command one more time. In the webhook selector you should now see your team there.\
On 6. Check if subscription is saved via /figma list command.\
On 7. Also you can receive notification in private messages. It will happen for: a) Owner of the file. b) Those who were mentioned in the comment via @nickname. c) Owner of the root comment, if it\`s a reply to his comment. Owner of the comment doesn\`t receive any of those.
