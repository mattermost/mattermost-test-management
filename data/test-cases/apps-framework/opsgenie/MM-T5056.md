## MM-T5056: OpsGenie command: `/genie alert unack`

---

**Step 1 from MM-T5049: OpsGenie command: `/genie configure`**

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: Steps 1.1 to 1.2 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T5049 test case. -->

_**Step 1.1 from MM-T5048: Set up OpsGenie App**_

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: Step 1.1.1 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T5048 test case. -->

_**Step 1.1.1**_

1\. Login to a Mattermost instance as sysadmin and ensure the Apps Plugin is enabled\
2\. Execute command `/apps install http OPSGENIE\_URL`\
3\. Select the `Agree to grant the app access to APIs and Locations` checkbox and click `Submit`\
4\. Run `/genie` command

_**Expected**_

On 1. Command `/apps` is available\
On 2. A modal appears, asking for admin's consent\
On 3. The appsbot sends a confirmation ephemeral post\
On 4. OpsGenie icon is shown, as two of the additional commands: `help` and `configure`

_**Step 1.2**_

2\. Run the `/genie configure` command\
3\. Add OpsGenie API key\
4\. Click `Submit`\
5\. Run the `/genie configure` command\
6\. Run the `/genie` command

_**Expected**_

On 2. An empty modal asking for the OpsGenie API key appears\
On 4. If OpsGenie API key is not valid, an error is displayed on modal, otherwise, a confirmation ephemeral post from OpsGenie App bot appears\
On 5. A modal with the previous OpsGenie API key appears\
On 6. Command `/subscription`, `/alert` and `/list` are shown

---

**Step 2**

2\. Run the `/genie alert unack` command\
3\. Add alert's tiny ID (number of alert)\
4\. Execute action\
5\. Run /genie close on the unacknowledged alert

**Expected**

On 2. Both options to execute are shown: executing command or input options as part of commands\
On 4. The data is validated. OpsGenie App bot returns an ephemeral post as a response:\
\- If the alert ID is valid, the alert changes to an unacknowledged state,\
\- If the alert ID is not valid, the post shows the `Alert with tiny \[ID] not found.`\
If the alert is already unacknowledged the error message appears as `Unacknowledge request will be processed for #\[ID]`\
On 5. Alert successfully closes
