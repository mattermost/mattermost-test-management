**Step 1 from MM-T5064: Set up PagerDuty master account**

2\. On a Mattermost instance, login as a sysadmin user and run command `/pd configure` on any channel\
3\. Record Client ID and Client Secret from the configuration generated through PagerDuty and click `Submit`

2\. From Mattermost with a user, run the help command, typing in the channel `/pd help`

**Expected**

On 2. The list of commands allowed with the PagerDuty integration will be displayed
