3\. Click on the generated link to direct you to the PagerDuty's authentication page\
4\. Enter the credentials of a valid PagerDuty's account and accept the permissions requested by PagerDuty

_**Expected**_

On 3. Based on the master configuration, an address must be generated to the PagerDuty's page to start the session.\
On 4. An authenticated user is created in the Mattermost session

---
