---

**Step 1 from MM-T5065: Link Mattermost account with PagerDuty**

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: Steps 1.1 to 1.2 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T5065 test case. -->

_**Step 1.1 from MM-T5064: Set up PagerDuty master account**_

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: Step 1.1.1 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T5064 test case. -->

2\. On a Mattermost instance, login as a sysadmin user and run command `/pd configure` on any channel\
3\. Record Client ID and Client Secret from the configuration generated through PagerDuty and click `Submit`

_**Expected**_

On 2. A configuration modal will appear on screen\
On 3. Configuration data is saved and any user could be able to see `connect` and `disconnect` from commands

_**Step 1.2**_

2\. From Mattermost with a user, execute the account link command with pagerduty, writing in a channel `/pd connect`\
3\. Click on the generated link to direct you to the PagerDuty's authentication page\
4\. Enter the credentials of a valid PagerDuty's account and accept the permissions requested by PagerDuty

_**Expected**_

On 3. Based on the master configuration, an address must be generated to the PagerDuty's page to start the session.\
On 4. An authenticated user is created in the Mattermost session

---

**Step 2**

2\. On any Mattermost channel, run command `/pd list service`

**Expected**

On 2. The list of services registered in PagerDuty will be displayed based on the configuration of the connected account
