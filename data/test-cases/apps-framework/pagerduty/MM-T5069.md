3\. Click on the generated link to direct you to the PagerDuty's authentication page\
4\. Enter the credentials of a valid PagerDuty's account and accept the permissions requested by PagerDuty

_**Expected**_

On 3. Based on the master configuration, an address must be generated to the PagerDuty's page to start the session.\
On 4. An authenticated user is created in the Mattermost session

---

**Step 2**

2\. On any Mattermost channel, run command `/pd list oncall`\
3\. Click on `View detail` link from any item
