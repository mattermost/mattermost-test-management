## MM-T4812: Cloud Call Limits

---

**Step 1**

Create 2 of your own users on the test server - User A + User B.

To generate extra simulated users and easily reach the limits - checkout the `lt` branch of `mattermost-plugin-calls` and run:

```
go run ./lt/client.go -url '${URL}' -team ${TEAM_ID} -admin-password Sys@dmin123 -users-per-call 7 -join-duration 1s -duration 60s
```

When the call limit is reached on Professional & Enterprise, the join banner should be hidden, the header and custom post join buttons are disabled, and `/call join` does not join.

**On-Prem**

- channels - can start and join calls, no user limit
- DM - can start and join calls
- GM - can start and join calls

**Starter**

- channels - cannot start call
- DM - can start and join calls
- GM - cannot start call

**Professional**

- channels - start a call with 7 users using the load test command -> join call with User A -> verify that User B cannot join and see the appropriate UI changes -> leave with User A -> verify that User B can now join
- DM - can start and join calls
- GM - can start and join calls

**Enterprise**:

- channels - start a call with 7 users using the load test command -> join call with User A -> verify that User B cannot join and see the appropriate UI changes -> leave with User A -> verify that User B can now join
- DM - can start and join calls
- GM -can start and join calls
