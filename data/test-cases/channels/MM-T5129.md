---

**Step 1**

1. Enable group Unreads separately 

2. Have one unread channel, e.g. Channel A

3. Join and Mute channel B (Pre-requisite:  muted channel must have a mention, and there must be < 5 unread channels on the team)

4. Receive a mention in the muted channel B 

   1. Verify muted channel is listed on the bottom of the Unreads section on the LHS

5. Open Find Channel modal (channel switcher)

   1. Verify unread muted channel in not listed in the unread section 

6. Search for the muted channel on the find channel modal

   1. Verify Channel B can still be found

**Expected**

- Muted channel is not listed in the Unread section of the Find Channel modal
- Muted channel can still be found, is shown on the results list when searching on Find Channel modal
