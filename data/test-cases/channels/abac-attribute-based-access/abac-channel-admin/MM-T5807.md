## MM-T5807: Visibility of Access Control tab in Channel Settings

---

**Step 1**

1. As system admin, navigate to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console

2. Click "Add policy" to create a new ABAC policy

3. Switch to Advanced mode using the mode toggle/selector

4. Test invalid syntax scenarios in the Advanced mode editor:

   - Enter malformed expressions (e.g., missing operators, unbalanced parentheses)
   - Use invalid attribute names that don't exist
   - Use incorrect operator syntax
   - Enter incomplete expressions

5. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for each invalid syntax

6. Test valid complex syntax scenarios:

   - Multiple attribute conditions with AND/OR operators
   - Nested expressions with proper parentheses
   - Complex string matching and comparison operations
   - Valid attribute names and operators

7. Verify that valid syntax is accepted and processed correctly

8. Test real-time validation (if available) vs. validation on save/submit

9. Verify that error messages are clear, specific, and helpful for troubleshooting

**Expected**

- Advanced mode provides syntax validation for policy expressions
- Invalid syntax triggers clear, specific error messages
- Error messages indicate the location and nature of syntax errors
- Valid complex expressions are accepted and processed correctly
- Validation occurs at appropriate times (real-time and/or on save)
- Error messages provide helpful guidance for correcting syntax issues
- Advanced mode supports complex logical expressions with proper operator precedence
- Syntax highlighting or formatting aids (if available) work correctly
- User can successfully create complex policies using Advanced mode syntax
