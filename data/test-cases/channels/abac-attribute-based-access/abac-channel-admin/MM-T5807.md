## MM-T5807: Visibility of Access Control tab in Channel Settings

---

**Step 1**

Verify Access Control tab appears for eligible users and channels

1. Login as a Channel Admin user
2. Navigate to a private channel where user has Channel Admin permissions
3. Open Channel Settings modal from channel name drop-down
4. Verify "Access Control" tab is visible and accessible
5. Switch to a public channel and repeat steps 2-4
6. Login as a regular user (non-admin) and repeat steps 2-4 for private channel

**Expected**

- Access Control tab is visible for Channel Admins in private channels only
- Tab is hidden for public channels
- Tab is hidden for non-admin users in private channels
- Tab displays appropriate content when clicked
