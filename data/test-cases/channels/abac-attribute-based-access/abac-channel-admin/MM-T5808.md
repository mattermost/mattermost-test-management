## MM-T5808: Prevent Loss of Unsaved Changes to Channel Access Rules

---

**Step 1**

1. As system admin, navigate to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console

2. Click "Add policy" to create a new ABAC policy

3. Configure policy settings (name, auto-add preference, etc.)

4. Set up policy conditions using either Basic or Advanced mode (e.g., Department = "Engineering")

5. Before saving the policy, click the "Test Access Rule" button/link

6. Observe the preview results showing which users would be affected by this policy

7. Verify that the preview accurately lists users who meet the policy criteria

8. Verify that users who do not meet the criteria are not included in the preview

9. Test with different policy configurations and verify preview accuracy:

   - Single attribute condition
   - Multiple attribute conditions with AND logic
   - Multiple attribute conditions with OR logic
   - Complex nested conditions (if supported)

10. Modify the policy conditions and re-run "Test Access Rule" to verify updated results

**Expected**

- "Test Access Rule" functionality is available during policy creation/editing
- Preview accurately shows all users who would be affected by the current policy configuration
- Preview excludes users who do not meet the policy criteria
- User list includes relevant user information (name, username, attributes, etc.)
- Preview updates correctly when policy conditions are modified
- Preview works for both Basic and Advanced mode policy configurations
- Results are clearly presented and easy to understand
- Preview helps admin validate policy logic before implementation
- Performance is acceptable even with large user bases
- Preview functionality works consistently across different policy complexity levels
