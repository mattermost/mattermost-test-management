## MM-T5808: Prevent Loss of Unsaved Changes to Channel Access Rules

---

**Step 1**

Test unsaved changes tracking and prevention of tab switching

1. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to private channel
2. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
3. Make changes to access rules (add, edit, or delete rule)
4. Attempt to switch to another tab without saving
5. Verify unsaved changes warning appears
6. Test "Undo" functionality to reset changes
7. Make changes again and use proper save workflow
8. Verify tab switching is allowed after saving

**Expected**

- Unsaved changes are tracked and displayed in SaveChangesPanel
- Tab switching is prevented when unsaved changes exist
- Warning notification appears for unsaved changes
- Undo functionality resets to last saved state
- After saving, tab switching is allowed normally
- SaveChangesPanel integrates seamlessly with existing Channel Settings workflow
