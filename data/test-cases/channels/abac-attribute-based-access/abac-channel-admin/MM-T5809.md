## MM-T5809: Channel Access Rule Removal

---

**Step 1**

Test empty state display and behavior when all rules are removed

1. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to private channel with no access rules
2. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
3. Verify appropriate empty state message is displayed
4. Add one or more access rules
5. Enable auto-add toggle
6. Delete all access rules one by one
7. Verify auto-add toggle is automatically disabled
8. Confirm channel returns to standard access state
9. Verify empty state display returns

**Expected**

- Empty state shows helpful message when no rules are configured
- Auto-add toggle is disabled when no rules exist
- Removing all rules returns channel to standard access mode
- Auto-add toggle automatically disables when last rule is removed
- Empty state provides guidance for adding first rule
