## MM-T5810: Channel Access Rule Validation and Security

---

**Step 1**

Verify permission enforcement and security boundaries

1. Login as Channel Admin and create access rules for Channel A
2. Navigate to Channel B (where user is also Channel Admin)
3. Verify user cannot manage Channel A's rules from Channel B
4. Attempt direct API calls to manage rules for channels without permissions
5. Login as regular user and attempt to access Channel Settings > Access Control
6. Verify users can only manage policies for their own channels
7. Test that channel ownership validation prevents cross-channel access

**Expected**

- Channel Admins can only manage rules for their own channels
- API endpoints validate channel ownership and permissions
- Users without MANAGE\_CHANNEL\_ACCESS\_RULES permission cannot access features
- Cross-channel rule management is prevented
- All operations properly validate permissions server-side
