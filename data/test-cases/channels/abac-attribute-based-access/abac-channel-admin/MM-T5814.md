## MM-T5814: Channel Access Rule Self-Exclusion Prevention

---

**Step 1**

Verify system prevents Channel Admin from excluding themselves

1. Login as Channel Admin (note admin's user attributes, e.g., Department = Marketing)
2. Navigate to private channel and open Channel Settings > Access Control
3. Attempt to create a rule that would exclude the admin (e.g., Department = Engineering)
4. Try to save the rule
5. Verify error message appears preventing the save
6. Modify the rule to include the admin's attributes
7. Verify the rule can now be saved successfully

**Expected**

- System detects when admin would be excluded by their own rule
- Error message displays clearly explaining the self-exclusion issue
- Save operation is blocked until rule is corrected
- Error message suggests admin cannot set rule that would remove them
- Once rule is corrected to include admin, save succeeds

**Notes**

- What if an admin's attributes change after they set the policy, making them excluded from the channel after the fact?
