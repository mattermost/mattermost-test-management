## MM-T5815: Global Policy Display in Channel Access Control

---

**Step 1**

Verify display of inherited system-level access policies

1. As System Admin, create a system-level access policy that affects channels
2. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to affected private channel
3. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
4. Verify system policy information banner is displayed at top
5. Confirm global policies are shown in read-only format
6. Verify messaging explains additive behavior of channel + global rules
7. Attempt to edit or remove the global policy display
8. Create a channel-level rule and verify both policies are considered

**Expected**

- System policies affecting the channel are clearly displayed
- Global policies appear in read-only format (cannot be edited)
- Info banner explains that channel rules are additive to system policies
- Clear messaging indicates users must satisfy both global and channel rules
- Channel Admin cannot modify or remove global policy display
