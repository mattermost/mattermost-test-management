## MM-T5816: Channel Access Rule Validation

---

**Step 1**

Test validation for empty fields and duplicate rules

1. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to private channel
2. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
3. Click "Add Rule" but leave attribute field empty, attempt to save
4. Fill attribute but leave value empty, attempt to save
5. Create a complete rule (e.g., Department = Engineering)
6. Attempt to create identical duplicate rule
7. Try creating similar rule with same attribute but different operator
8. Verify appropriate validation messages for each scenario

**Expected**

- Empty required fields are highlighted with validation errors
- Save is prevented when required fields are missing
- Duplicate rule detection prevents identical rules from being created
- Clear error messages guide user to complete or fix invalid entries
- Conflicting rules are detected and user is warned appropriately
