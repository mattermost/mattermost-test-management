## MM-T5817: Immediate Member Sync on Rule Save

---

**Step 1**

Verify immediate member sync when access rules are saved

1. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to private channel with existing members
2. Note current channel member list (include users who don't match future rule)
3. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
4. Create restrictive access rule that some current members won't match
5. Save the rule and return to channel
6. Verify that non-matching members are immediately removed from channel
7. Check that matching members remain in the channel
8. Verify channel member count updates accordingly

**Expected**

- Rule save triggers immediate channel membership sync
- Users who no longer meet criteria are removed from channel immediately
- Users who meet criteria remain in channel
- Channel member list updates in real-time
- Admin who created rule remains in channel (due to self-exclusion prevention)
