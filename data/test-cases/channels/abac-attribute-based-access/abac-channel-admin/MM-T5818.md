## MM-T5818: Conflicting Channel Access Rules Detection

---

**Step 1**

Detection of conflicting access rules

1. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to private channel
2. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
3. Create first rule: Department = Engineering
4. Attempt to create conflicting rule: Department = Sales
5. Verify system detects impossible combination (user cannot be in two departments)
6. Check for warning message about conflicting rules
7. Try to save and verify save is prevented or warning is shown
8. Test with non-conflicting rules on different attributes

**Expected**

- System detects when rules create impossible conditions
- Warning message indicates no user can satisfy all rules
- Clear guidance provided to resolve conflicts
- Save operation either prevented or shows confirmation dialog
- Non-conflicting rules on different attributes save successfully
