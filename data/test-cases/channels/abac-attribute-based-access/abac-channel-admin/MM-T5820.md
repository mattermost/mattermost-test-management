## MM-T5820: ABAC and LDAP Group Sync Coexistence

---

**Step 1**

Verify ABAC rules and LDAP Group Sync work together without conflicts

1. Set up channel with existing LDAP Group Sync (synced groups configured)
2. Login as Channel Admin and navigate to the synced channel
3. Open Channel Settings > Access Control tab
4. Create ABAC access rule (e.g., Department = Engineering)
5. Save the ABAC rule and verify it applies alongside existing group sync
6. Check that users must satisfy BOTH group membership AND ABAC rules
7. Add user to LDAP group but ensure they don't match ABAC rule
8. Verify user is not added to channel despite group membership
9. Modify user attributes to match ABAC rule and verify they're now added

**Expected**

- ABAC rules and LDAP Group Sync operate independently without conflicts
- Users must satisfy both group membership and ABAC criteria to access channel
- ABAC rules act as additional filter on top of group sync membership
- Channel membership updates properly when either condition changes
- Both systems maintain their individual functionality
