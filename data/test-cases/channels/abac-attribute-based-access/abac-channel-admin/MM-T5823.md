## MM-T5823: Channel Settings UI with ABAC and LDAP Group Sync

---

**Step 1**

Verify Channel Settings modal displays both LDAP Group Sync and Access Control appropriately

1. Set up channel with LDAP Group Sync enabled and configured
2. Login as Channel Admin and open Channel Settings modal
3. Navigate to Groups tab and verify existing synced groups are displayed
4. Switch to Access Control tab and verify it's available
5. Create ABAC rules in Access Control tab
6. Return to Groups tab and confirm group sync settings are unchanged
7. Verify no UI conflicts or overlapping functionality between tabs
8. Test saving changes in one tab doesn't affect the other tab's settings

**Expected**

- Both Groups tab and Access Control tab are visible and functional
- No UI conflicts or confusion between the two access control methods
- Settings in each tab operate independently
- Clear separation between group-based and attribute-based access controls
- Both tabs maintain their respective functionality without interference
