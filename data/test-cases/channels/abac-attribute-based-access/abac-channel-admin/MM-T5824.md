## MM-T5824: Conflict Resolution Between ABAC and LDAP

---

**Step 1**

Test system behavior when LDAP sync and ABAC rules create conflicting membership changes

1. Set up channel with LDAP Group Sync and ABAC rules
2. Create scenario where user is added to LDAP group (should be added to channel)
3. Simultaneously ensure user doesn't match ABAC rules (should be excluded)
4. Trigger both sync operations and verify final channel membership state
5. Test reverse scenario: user removed from LDAP group but still matches ABAC
6. Verify system handles simultaneous conflicting sync operations gracefully
7. Check that error handling prevents inconsistent channel states
8. Verify audit logs capture both sync operations and final resolution

**Expected**

- System resolves conflicts by applying most restrictive access (AND logic)
- No inconsistent channel membership states occur during conflicting syncs
- Final membership reflects combined requirements of both systems
- Error handling prevents data corruption during conflict resolution
- Audit logs properly document conflict resolution decisions
