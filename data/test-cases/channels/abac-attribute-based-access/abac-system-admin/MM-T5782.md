## MM-T5782: System admin can enable or disable system-wide attribute-based access

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

On a server with Enterprise Advanced (aka Premium) license:\
1\. Log in as system admin, view Attribute-based access page in System Console under User Management section\
2\. Click to enable Attribute-based access, observe controls on page are functional and if policies exist they are enacted as specified\
3\. Click to disable Attribute-based access, observe controls on page are not functional and if policies exist they are not enacted

**Expected**

When enabled by system admin, configuration is editable and policies are enacted. When disabled by system admin, configuration is not editable and policies are not enacted.
