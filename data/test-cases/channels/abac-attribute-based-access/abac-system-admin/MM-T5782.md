2\. Click to enable Attribute-based access, observe controls on page are functional and if policies exist they are enacted as specified\
3\. Click to disable Attribute-based access, observe controls on page are not functional and if policies exist they are not enacted

**Expected**

When enabled by system admin, configuration is editable and policies are enacted. When disabled by system admin, configuration is not editable and policies are not enacted.
