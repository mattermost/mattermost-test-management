## MM-T5783: Attribute-based access policy created in System Console controls access as specified (one attribute, `= is`, without auto-add)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System â€‹Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, leave auto-add set to False\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value (just one)\
3\. Click Test Access Rule, observe users are listed who satisfy the policy\
4\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
5\. Have a user who satisfies the policy but is not yet in the channel observe that they are not auto-added\
6\. Have a user who satisfies the policy and is already in the channel observe no change\
7\. Have a user who does not satisfy the policy and is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel (auto-add setting only refers to adding; noncompliant users are still removed)\
8\. As system admin in the channel you are able to add the user who satisfies the policy to the channel

**Expected**

\- User who satisfies the policy is not auto-added, but is able to be added by a user with permission in that channel\
\- User who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed
