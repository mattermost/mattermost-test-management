## MM-T5785: Attribute-based access policy that uses all the attribute types, including multi-select with multiple values, controls access as specified (multiple attributes, `= is`, with auto-add)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System â€‹Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, set Auto-add to True\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value\
3\. Repeat so all attribute types are used:\
\- Text\
\- Phone\
\- URL\
\- Select\
\- Multiple Select (include multiple qualifying values)\
4\. Click Test Access Rule, observe users are listed who satisfy the policy\
5\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
6\. Have a user who satisfies the policy but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
7\. Have a user who satisfies the policy and is already in the channel observe no change\
8\. Have a user who meets only some of the rules and is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the multi-rule policy with multiple attribute types is auto-added.\
User who does not satisfy all rules in the policy is auto-removed.
