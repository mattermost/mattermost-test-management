## MM-T5786: Attribute-based access policy using operator variations in Simple mode controls access as specified (one attribute, various operators, with auto-add)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, set Auto-add to True\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value (just one)\
3\. Change operator to \`=! is not\`\
4\. Click Test Access Rule, observe users are listed who satisfy the policy\
5\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
6\. Have a user who satisfies the policy using that specific operator but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
7\. Have a user who does not satisfy the policy using that specific operator and who is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the policy is auto-added.\
User who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed.

---

**Step 2**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, set Auto-add to True\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value (just one)\
3\. Change operator to \`∈ in\`\
4\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
5\. Have a user who satisfies the policy using that specific operator but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
6\. Have a user who does not satisfy the policy using that specific operator and who is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the policy is auto-added.\
User who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed.

---

**Step 3**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, set Auto-add to True\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value (just one)\
3\. Change operator to \`ƒ starts with\`\
4\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
5\. Have a user who satisfies the policy using that specific operator but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
6\. Have a user who does not satisfy the policy using that specific operator and who is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the policy is auto-added.\
User who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed.

---

**Step 4**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, set Auto-add to True\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value (just one)\
3\. Change operator to \`ƒ ends with\`\
4\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
5\. Have a user who satisfies the policy using that specific operator but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
6\. Have a user who does not satisfy the policy using that specific operator and who is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the policy is auto-added.\
User who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed.

**Step 5**

1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click Add policy. In policy view, enter policy name, set Auto-add to True\
2\. Select policy values: Attribute, Operator, and Value (just one)\
3\. Change operator to \`ƒ contains\`\
4\. Click Add channels and select a channel to add, then save (private channels only in first iteration)\
5\. Have a user who satisfies the policy using that specific operator but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
6\. Have a user who does not satisfy the policy using that specific operator and who is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the policy is auto-added.\
User who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed.
