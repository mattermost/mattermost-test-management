## MM-T5788: Add attribute-based policy to a channel from Channel Configuration page

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

With at least one policy in existence on the server:\
1\. As admin go to System Console > User Management > Channels\
2\. Click a channel that is currently listed with Management as \`Manual Invites\` (only private channel in first iteration)\
3\. Under Channel Management, toggle on \`Enable attribute based channel access\`\
4\. Select a policy and click Save

**Test Data**

Current notes:\
When adding a policy to a channel from the Channel Configuration page:\
\
Click to toggle on Enable attribute based channel access\
Click Save without selecting a policy first\
Right now it appears to save, it closes the Configuration page and returns to the Channels list page. But no changes were made, and no feedback was given to the user about what happened or didn't happen.\
\
Should the Channel Configuration page show an error and prevent saving if Save is clicked without selecting a policy?\
\
Also, ​after selecting a policy and clicking Save, should ​it say which users will be affected, like the Test User Access button on the other page? And do the changes take effect immediately?

**Expected**

User who satisfies the policy is not auto-added, but is able to be added by a user with permission in that channel.\
User ​who does not satisfy the policy is auto-removed.
