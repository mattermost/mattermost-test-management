## MM-T5789: Channel cannot use attribute-based policies if it is already constrained by LDAP group sync

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

With at least one policy in existence on the server and at least one channel configured to be constrained by LDAP group sync:\
1\. As admin go to System Console > User Management > Channels\
2\. Click a channel that is currently listed with Management as \`Group Sync\` (only private channel in first iteration)\
3\. Under Channel Management, observe that \`Enable attribute based channel access\` is not available\
4\. Toggle off \`Sync Group Members\` and ​observe \`Enable attribute based channel access\` appears and is available to ​toggle on

**Expected**

Attribute-based channel access is not available for a channel that is already set to use LDAP group sync

---

**Step 2**

With at least one policy in existence on the server and at least one channel configured to be constrained by LDAP group sync:\
1\. As admin go to System Console > User Management > Attribute-Based Access\
2\. Click a policy to edit it, click Add channels\
3\. Select a channel you know is constrained by LDAP group sync

**Test Data**

Then what should happen? Currently, the UI allows it to be saved, ​and ​edit mode closes as if it saves, but the channel is not added to the policy, and no feedback is given to the user about what did or did not happen. Should the user be prevented at some point from selecting a channel that ​uses ​LDAP group sync? Or ​it fails to save and prints an error explaining why?
