## MM-T5792: Editing existing access policy to remove one of the rules applies access control as specified (with auto-add)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System â€‹Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

With at least one policy in existence on the server that has multiple rules:\
1\. As system admin, go to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console and click a policy to edit. Ensure Auto-add is set to True\
2\. Edit an existing policy rule to remove one of the rules (attribute/value)\
3\. Click Test Access Rule, observe users are listed who satisfy the policy\
4\. Save the changes\
5\. Have a user who satisfies the newly edited policy but is not yet in the channel observe that they are auto-added\
6\. Have a user who no longer satisfies the newly edited policy and is already in the channel observe that they are auto-removed from the channel

**Expected**

User who satisfies the newly edited policy is auto-added to the channel.\
User who does not satisfy the newly edited policy is auto-removed.
