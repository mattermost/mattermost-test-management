## MM-T5794: User is auto-added to channel when a qualifying attribute is added to their profile (auto-add true)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System â€‹Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

With at least one access policy in existence on the server, set to auto-add, and applied to a channel:\
1\. As system admin make a note of the attribute needed for a user to be auto-added to a channel\
2\. As a user not in the channel and not having the required attribute\
3\. Click user's own profile picture top right and select Profile\
4\. Scroll down to the required custom attribute, click Edit, and add the required value\
5\. Save the changes

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy is auto-added to the channel\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System
