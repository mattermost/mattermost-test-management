2\. As a user not in the channel and not having the required attribute\
3\. Click user's own profile picture top right and select Profile\
4\. Scroll down to the required custom attribute, click Edit, and add the required value\
5\. Save the changes\
6\. As system admin go to the channel and add the user to the channel

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy can be added to the channel by the admin\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System
