## MM-T5797: LDAP sync: User is auto-added to channel when qualifying attribute syncs to their profile (auto-add true)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

Ensure a policy exists on the server, with one attribute, set to auto-add, syncing with LDAP, using \`= is\`, and applied to a channel:\
1\. As system admin make a note of the attribute needed for a user to be auto-added to a channel\
2\. Note an LDAP user not in the channel and not having the required attribute\
3\. On the LDAP server, add the required attribute to the user's profile\
4\. Back in Mattermost, sync LDAP

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy is auto-added to the channel\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System

---

**Step 2**

Repeat above but use a policy that has two required attributes, one set to use \`ƒ contains\`\
1\. Note an LDAP user who already has one of the required attributes but doesn't have the attribute that uses \`ƒ contains\`\
2\. On the LDAP server, add second required value to satisfy \`ƒ contains\`\
3\. In Mattermost, sync LDAP

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy is auto-added to the channel\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System
