## MM-T5798: LDAP sync: User can be added to channel by admin after editing qualifying attribute and syncing to their profile (auto-add false)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

Ensure a policy exists on the server, with one attribute, with auto-add false, syncing with LDAP, using \`= is\`, and applied to a channel:\
1\. As system admin make a note of the attribute needed for a user to be auto-added to a channel\
2\. Note an LDAP user not in the channel who has the attribute but a different value than is required\
3\. On the LDAP server, change the attribute on the user's profile to have the required value\
4\. Back in Mattermost, sync LDAP\
5\. Still as admin, go to channel and add the user

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy is added to the channel by the admin\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System

---

**Step 2**

Repeat above but use a policy that has an attribute set to use \`∈ in\`\
1\. Note an LDAP user who already has the required attribute but doesn't have a value that satisfies \`∈ in\`\
2\. On the LDAP server, change value to satisfy \`∈ in\`\
3\. In Mattermost, sync LDAP\
4\. Still as admin, go to channel and add the user

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy is added to the channel by admin\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System
