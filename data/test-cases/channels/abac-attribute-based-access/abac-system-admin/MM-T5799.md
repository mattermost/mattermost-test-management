## MM-T5799: LDAP sync: User is removed from channel after required attribute is removed from their LDAP account and synced (auto-add true or auto-add false)

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

Ensure a policy exists on the server, with one attribute, set to auto-add, syncing with LDAP, using \`ƒ starts with\`, and applied to a channel:\
1\. As system admin make a note of the attribute needed for a user to be auto-added to a channel\
2\. Note an LDAP user already in the channel who has the required attribute\
3\. On the LDAP server, remove the required attribute from the user's profile\
4\. Back in Mattermost, sync LDAP

**Expected**

\- User who no longer satisfies the policy is removed from the channel\
\- \`User removed\` message is posted in the channel by System

---

**Step 2**

Repeat above but use a policy that has two required attributes, both using \`= is\`\
1\. Note an LDAP user who already has both of the required attributes and is in the channel\
2\. On the LDAP server, remove one of the required attributes\
3\. In Mattermost, sync LDAP

**Expected**

\- User who no longer satisfies the policy is removed from the channel\
\- \`User removed\` message is posted in the channel by System
