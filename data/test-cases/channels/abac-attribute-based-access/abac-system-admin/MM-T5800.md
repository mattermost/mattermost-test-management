## MM-T5800: LDAP sync does not change the value of an attribute or its effect if a non-LDAP user had a value for it before it was set to sync with LDAP

**Precondition**

\- Enterprise advanced (formerly known as Premium) license\
\- --env MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_CustomProfileAttributes=true,MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AttributeBasedAccessControl=true\
\- Custom profile attributes have been created in System Console > System ​Attributes (Properties), so that they can be used to create a policy

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create custom profile attribute called \`Hello\` and do not add it to an ABAC policy or sync it with LDAP yet\
2\. As a non-LDAP user (email/password e.g.), set a value \`no\` for attribute \`Hello\` in your profile\
3\. As system admin, in System Console create a new policy with \`Hello\` attribute and value \`yes\`, auto-add true, and set the attribute to sync with LDAP. Map the \`Hello\` attribute to the \`description\` field on the LDAP server\
3\. On the LDAP server add value \`yes\` to the mapped attribute \`description\` on a third user's profile who logs in using LDAP\
4\. Back in Mattermost, have the LDAP user log in\
5\. As system admin, sync LDAP\
6\. Verify in the LDAP user's profile that they received the \`Hello\` \`yes\` value synced over from LDAP\
7\. As system admin, sync attribute-based access\
8\. As the LDAP user verify you are added to the channel that is linked to the policy\
9\. As the non-LDAP user verify you still have \`Hello\` set to \`no\` in your profile and cannot edit it (and have not been added to the linked channel)\
10\. As system admin change the policy to \`Hello\` =is \`no\` and sync attribute-based access

**Expected**

\- Non-LDAP user who now satisfies the policy is auto-added to the channel based on the value they had before the attribute was added to a policy\
\- LDAP user who no longer satisfies the policy is removed from the channel

---

**Step 2**

Repeat above but use a policy that has two required attributes, one set to use \`ƒ contains\`\
1\. Note an LDAP user who already has one of the required attributes but doesn't have the attribute that uses \`ƒ contains\`\
2\. On the LDAP server, add second required value to satisfy \`ƒ contains\`\
3\. In Mattermost, sync LDAP

**Expected**

\- User who now satisfies the policy is auto-added to the channel\
\- \`User added\` message is posted in the channel by System
