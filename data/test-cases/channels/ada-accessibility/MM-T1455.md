- [At-mention suggestions should not "remember" (highlight) the previous search but should highlight the first suggestion in the list — MM-19870](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19870)

**Expected**

- Down/up arrow moves through the results and reads the usernames as they get highlighted by the grey selection color. ie "eric\_8" "eric\_test2" etc.
- Down arrow moves down the results and reads the channel names and purposes as they get highlighted by the grey selection color. ie "apiv4. Discussion related to moving toward APIv4." "Apps Team" etc.
