- [ADA: Message Autocomplete does not read out matching entries properly in Edge and Firefox — MM-18383](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18373)

**Expected**

- Down arrow moves down the results and reads the usernames as they get highlighted. ie "ajames" "andrewmontagne" etc.
- Down arrow moves down the results and reads the channel handles as they get highlighted. ie "apiv4" "team-icu" etc.
