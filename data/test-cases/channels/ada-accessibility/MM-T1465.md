**Expected**

- Pay particular attention to these areas:

  - "x" button - "close button"
  - Display section. Tab through the settings section tabs to the display section - "display button"
  - Tab through a profile setting section - "full name edit", "username edit", "nickname edit", etc.
  - Radio buttons should not show visual focus indicator unless using keyboard navigation

   1. `Verify if the focus goes to the individual fields of each section`

2. Go to each section of the Settings modal

   1. `Verify if the focus goes to the individual fields of each section`

Accessibility support should be provided for each section in Settings and Profile
