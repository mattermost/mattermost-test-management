**Expected**

1. When a radio group receives focus via TAB:

   1. If a radio button is checked, focus is set on the checked button.
   2. If none of the radio buttons are checked, focus is set on the first radio button in the group.

2. Space/ENTER: checks the focused radio button if it is not already checked.

3. Right Arrow and Down Arrow: move focus to the next radio button in the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button. If focus is on the last button, focus moves to the first button.

4. Left Arrow and Up Arrow: move focus to the previous radio button in the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button. If focus is on the first button, focus moves to the last button.

**Note**: This applies to all radio buttons in the product, including:

- Account settings
- Channel notification preferences
- Team Settings
