**Step 1**

Popovers are accessible\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

- For a post, click on Emoji icon and press TAB to navigate between different emoji icons
- Enter a text in the message window with text ":sm" and wait for a second for a popover to appear. Press TAB to navigate between different emoji icons in the list.
- Click on the Channel Members icon and press TAB to navigate between different menu items
- Click on a User profile and press TAB to navigate between different fields displayed for a user

_Important notes about this step:_

- Ticket written for when the reader does not read emoji from the list when inserting within text using :emoji: ➜ MM-17284 closed as 'Cannot Reproduce"
- Reader does not read info in member profile pop-over [ES made a follow-up ticket](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22615?jql=issuetype%20%3D%20Bug%20AND%20reporter%20in%20(ericsethna)) (need to find link)

**Expected**

- Reader should read out the different emoji icons in the emoji picker
- **Reader should read out different emoji autocomplete lists shown to a user when user is about to enter an emoji in message window.**
- Reader should read out list of all channel members in a channel and also be able to Manage members (if the option is shown)
- **Reader should read out different information shown in a user popover**
