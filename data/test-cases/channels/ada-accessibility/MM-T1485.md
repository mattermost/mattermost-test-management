## MM-T1485: Language dropdown should read labels

---

**Step 1**

Settings > Display > Language dropdown should read labels\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Use screen reader and open Settings > Display > Language and attempt to access the dropdown with a keyboard.

- (**Story**) [ADA: Display > Language drop down is inaccessible via keyboard — MM-16133](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16133)
- (**Task**) [Accessibility Cypress Test Automation: Accessibility Support in Account Settings — MM-22628](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22628)

**Expected**

- Focus should be on the Change Language dropdown
- Up and Down arrow keys should change the language in the dropdown
- When Enter key is pressed in the dropdown, the dropdown should be expanded
- When Enter key is pressed in the dropdown when it's expanded, it should be collapsed
- Tab/Shift Tab should work and user should be allowed to save the new language
