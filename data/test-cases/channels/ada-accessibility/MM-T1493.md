## MM-T1493: Using TAB you can navigate to a post's content and it is read out

---

**Step 1**

Using TAB you can navigate to a post's content and it is read out\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Use CTRL+F6 (F6 on desktop app) to navigate to the text input region in any channel
2. Post a message containing a couple of lines (can use SHIFT+Enter to create blank lines but make sure there is also text between the lines)
3. Press CTRL+F6 to navigate the reader to the post you've just made
4. Press TAB to cycle through the elements on the post

_Related ticket(s):_

- (**Story**) [ADA: Post content should be included in the TAB loop as read only — MM-17047](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17047)
- (**Task**) [Accessibility Cypress Test Automation: Accessibility Support in Post — MM-22631](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22631)

**Expected**

- The reader should move to and read out each element on the post including the post body\
  e.g.:

  - "Username button"
  - "\[time posted] link"
  - "flag for follow up button"
  - "more actions button collapsed"
  - "add reaction button"
  - "reply button"
    \
    reads out contents of the post and shows a focus line around the post
