## MM-T1499: Screen reader should not switch to virtual cursor mode while navigating with CTRL+F6/F6, arrow keys or TAB, unless virtual cursor mode is toggled on/off by the user

---

**Step 1**

Screen reader should not switch to virtual cursor mode while navigating with CTRL+F6/F6, arrow keys or TAB, unless virtual cursor mode is toggled on/off by the user\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Open JAWS and toggle virtual PC cursor off with INS+Z
2. Use CTRL+F6/F6 to navigate and loop through all app regions
3. In each regions, use up/down arrows or TAB and ensure green highlighting is not seen

**Expected**

- When navigating between different app regions and while navigating within each region, green highlighting should not be seen.
- Screen reader stays in "form mode" and does not switch over to virtual cursor mode
  \
  **Tip**: You can check whether virtual cursor mode is on/off by pressing "Insert+Z" on your keyboard (this toggles virtual cursor mode on/off
