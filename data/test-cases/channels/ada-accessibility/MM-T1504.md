**Step 1**

–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Type some characters in the message input box (be sure to include a `\~` and an `@`)
2. Use the arrow keys to move back and forth through the text

**Expected**

- Characters are read when arrowing through them and text can be reviewed with INSERT+5, INSERT+8
- This should apply to the RHS and main message input fields
