## MM-T1505: Clicking on a post does not show it as highlighted when returning to the MM window

---

**Step 1**

Clicking on a post does not show it as highlighted when returning to the MM window\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click on a post (not a button or link in a post)
2. Switch to a new tab and switch back
3. Move the mouse without clicking

[Clicking on a post will highlight it after returning to the tab/window — MM-17786](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17786)

**Expected**

- There should be no visual updates to the post
  \
  (i.e. the post should not receive an a11y focus outline nor should it show permanent highlighting as if it were being hovered over)
