## MM-T1505: Clicking on a post does not show it as highlighted when returning to the MM window

---

**Step 1**

Clicking on a post does not show it as highlighted when returning to the MM window\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click on a post (not a button or link in a post)
2. Switch to a new tab and switch back
3. Move the mouse without clicking

[Clicking on a post will highlight it after returning to the tab/window — MM-17786](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17786)

**Expected**

- There should be no visual updates to the post\
  (i.e. the post should not receive an a11y focus outline nor should it show permanent highlighting as if it were being hovered over)
