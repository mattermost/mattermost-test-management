## MM-T1506: All buttons/menus where reader reads 'Press spacebar to activate' should open by pressing space bar

---

**Step 1**

All buttons/menus where reader reads "Press spacebar to activate" should open by pressing space bar\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

- This is a huge area to test - here's the short list:

  - Message List Main Region (center panel) and Message Details (RHS)
  - Reply Input Region (RHS)
  - MESSAGE DETAILS (top of reply area in RHS)
  - Message Input Complimentary Region (center)
  - Team Menu Region (top of LHS)
  - Channel Sidebar Region (LHS)
  - Channel Header Region (top of Center)
  - Region at the top of a newly created channel
  - Main Menu - Account Settings
  - Main Menu - All options - the reader reads out the option name (e.g. Account Settings ➜ Invite People ➜ etc.) but does NOT read "Press Space Bar to activate" although pressing Space Bar to activate DOES work for SOME options (see below in the notes)

_Important notes about this step:_

- The sections within the Main Menu that do not open using Space Bar are:

  - Create a New Team
  - Integrations
  - System Console
  - Help
  - Report a Problem
  - Download Apps

**Expected**

- All buttons/menus where reader reads "press spacebar to activate" should open by pressing space bar
