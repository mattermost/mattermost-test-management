## MM-T1512: IE11 only - CTRL+F6 should do nothing

---

**Step 1**

IE11 only - CTRL+F6 should do nothing\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in Jaws and to MM on IE11
2. Try to navigate using CTRL+F6

_Related ticket(s):_

(**Story**) [ADA: Disable the navigation controller on IE11 — MM-17086](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17086)

_Important notes about this step:_

If you use just F6 you might notice navigation of sorts but this has nothing to do with Jaws/Accessibility changes and more to do with F6 already being a browser shortcut key

**Expected**

- CTRL+F6 should do nothing
