## MM-T3869: Channel Sidebar TAB navigation - move channels within category

---

**Step 1**

_Channel Sidebar TAB navigation - move/re-arrange channels within the category_

1. Open Mattermost (with the new sidebar active).
2. Using F6 (or Ctrl/Cmd + F6) navigate to the sidebar
3. Tab until one of the channels is highlighted with a gray border. Make sure you're in a category with multiple channels (category can be set to manual sorting, if not channel will snap back to it's original sorted position, tabbing, selecting and dropping should still work)
4. Press SPACE and then use the arrow keys to move the channel down.
5. Press SPACE again to release the channel. The channel should be in its new position.
6. Continue to tab through channels on the LHS

**Expected**

After channel is dropped, it should remain selected/focused allowing user to resume tabbing through the channels.
