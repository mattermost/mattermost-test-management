## MM-T5: Add User — User A & User B (removed from team)

**Objective**

If **User B** has been removed from the current team, **User A** should not see "Add to channel" option on **User B's** profile pop-over

**Precondition**

- This test assumes permissions are in place for users to see the option on other users who belong to the team's profile pop-overs

---

**Step 1**

1. Remove a member from a team
2. @ mention the user you just removed in a channel
3. Click the @ mention in the post you just made

_Related ticket(s):_

(**Story**) ["Add to channel" option is visible on a user's profile pop-over when they've been removed from a team — MM-17413](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17413)

**Expected**

After #2,

- @ mention is accepted as a post

After #3,

- "Add to Channel" should not be present as the member has been removed from the team
