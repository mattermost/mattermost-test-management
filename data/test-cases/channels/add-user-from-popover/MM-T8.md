## MM-T8: Add User — User A & User B (not on team)

**Objective**

- If User A has never been a member of the current team, **User B** should not see "Add to channel" option on **users's** profile pop-over

**Precondition**

- This test assumes permissions are in place for users to see the option on other users who belong to the team's profile pop-overs

---

**Step 1**

1. Create a new team
2. @ mention a user in a channel on the new team that is not a member of your new team
3. Click the @ mention in the post you just made

[Non-obvious error when trying to add a user via "Add to a Channel" profile popover option to a channel within a team they don't belong to — MM-16056](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16056)

**Expected**

On 2, @ mention is accepted as a post.\
On 3,

- User's profile popover opens
- "Add to Channel" should not be present as the member isn't part of the team
