## MM-T1677: Archived channels are not shown as unread in channel switcher

**Precondition**

_**Important:**_

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

---

**Step 1**

–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As the test user join a public channel then open any other channel in the drawer
2. As another user post in the channel from step 1. then archive it
3. As the test user hit CTRL/CMD+K (or ⌘+k) and locate the channel

**Expected**

- Channel does not appear at the top with other unread channels
