## MM-T1681: Deprecated - do not test: Open an archived channel using reply from search results

**Objective**

QA Note: testing is covered in MM-T1680. Automated in Chrome.\
We can possibly consider keeping as manual mobile test? (jelena gilliam)

**Precondition**

_**Important:**_

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

**Step 1**

Open an archived channel using reply from search results\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create or locate post in an archived channel where the test user had permissions to edit channel details
2. Locate the post in a search
3. Click reply to open the reply thread of a post in an archived channel

**Expected**

**Desktop**:

1. Content of main thread does not change
2. Reply thread is opened showing the contents of the thread
3. Footer show message explaining that you are viewing an archived channel
4. Footer shows no input box

**Mobile**:

1. Reply thread is displayed
2. Channel name is visible in header
3. Back arrow is available to close thread and return to search results (not to channel)
4. Footer shows you are viewing an archived channel
