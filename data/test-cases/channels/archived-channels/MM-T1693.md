## MM-T1693: RN apps: If a user manages to open an archived channel in the wrong state, error handling prevents them from updating metadata

**Precondition**

_**Important:**_

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

---

**Step 1**

If a user manages to open an archived channel in the wrong state, error handling prevents them from updating metadata\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Have another user add you to a channel and make you a channel admin
2. Note the unread channel in the drawer
3. Set your device to airplane mode
4. As the other user, archive the channel
5. Disable airplane mode
6. Open the channel from the drawer
7. Tap on channel header and select "Edit Channel"
8. Attempt to edit the channel name, header or purpose

**Expected**

- An Error is displayed: "_You cannot modify an archived channel_"
- When you leave the edit page the channel will now show as archived
