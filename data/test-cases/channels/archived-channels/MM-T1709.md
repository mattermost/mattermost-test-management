_**Important:**_

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
First, as system admin, ensure that System Console > Users and Teams > Allow users to view archived channels is set to `false`.\
\\

1. Post a unique string of text in a channel
