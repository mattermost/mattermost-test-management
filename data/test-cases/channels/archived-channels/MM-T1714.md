## MM-T1714: Redirect to archived channel view (if viewing archived channels is enabled on the system) otherwise redirect to last viewed channel

**Precondition**

_**Important:**_

Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

**Step 1**

Redirect to archived channel view (if viewing archived channels is enabled on the system) otherwise redirect to last viewed channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create or locate a channel you're a member of
2. Post distinctive text in the channel such as "I like pineapples"
3. Select Archive Channel from the header menu
4. Select Archive

- [Leaving a channel when the previous channel has been archived should redirect to Town Square — MM-32319](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-32319)

_Important notes about this step:_

Note: If viewing archived channels is not enabled on the server, you are redirected to last viewed channel. If the last viewed channel is also archived, you are redirected to Town Square

**Expected**

- You should be redirected to archived channel view
