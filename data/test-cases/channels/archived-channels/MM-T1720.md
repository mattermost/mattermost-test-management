Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

Cannot add to existing reaction\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a post and add a reaction :slightly\_frowning\_face:

2. Archive the channel

3. Using a different user locate a post in the archive channel where user from step one already reacted

4. Click on :slightly\_frowning\_face: emoji, should not increment\
   Ensure to check:

   - Main thread

- Existing reactions are not responsive when you select them and count does not increment
