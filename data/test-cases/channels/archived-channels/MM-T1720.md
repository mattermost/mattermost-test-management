Ensure that `Allow users to view archived channels` is enabled on the server and some public and private archived channels exist\
(Setting can be found in System Console under "Users and Teams")

**Step 1**

Cannot add to existing reaction\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a post and add a reaction :slightly\_frowning\_face:

2. Archive the channel

3. Using a different user locate a post in the archive channel where user from step one already reacted

4. Click on :slightly\_frowning\_face: emoji, should not increment\
   Ensure to check:

   - Main thread
   - RHS Reply thread

**Expected**

- "+" is no longer visible to add another reaction
- Existing reactions are not responsive when you select them and count does not increment
