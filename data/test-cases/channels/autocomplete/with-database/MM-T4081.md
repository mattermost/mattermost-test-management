## MM-T4081: Users in correct in/out of channel sections

---

**Step 1**

Note: This test requires Elasticsearch and Bleve to be disabled.\
\
Users in correct in/out of channel sections\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\

1. Start an at-mention that returns users that are member and not member of the channel you're currently viewing.

**Expected**

Users in the autocomplete suggestion list should correctly group as "Channel Members" and "Not in Channel"
