2\. Click the channel name, select Channel Settings, then click Configuration in the modal's left nav\
3\. Click the toggle to enable Channel banner, observe banner options appear\
4\. Leave banner text empty and click Save

Verify that an error message "Please enter text to enable channel banner" is displayed when the banner is enabled but the text field is left blank

1\. Enter text in a channel banner and save\
2\. Open Channel Settings > Configuration â€‹again, and remove all text from the channel banner text field

**Expected**
