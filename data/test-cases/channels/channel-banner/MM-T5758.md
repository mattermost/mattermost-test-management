---

**Step 1**

1\. Under channel drop-down menu, select Channel Settings and click Configuration in the modal's left nav\
2\. Click toggle to enable Channel Banner\
3\. Enter long text in the text field that includes a link, such as:\
\
This text will be long enough to truncate on most regular browser widths, and definitely if RHS is open or browser is narrowed. On hover the entirety will appear in a tooltip. \[This link to Github]\(https\://github.com/mattermost) will open in a browser, even when clicked from the tooltip.\
\
4\. Click Save and close the modal, observe the channel banner above center channel, with the text truncated and an ellipsis at the end to indicate it's truncated\
5\. Hover over the banner and observe the entirety of the text appearing in a tooltip\
6\. Click the link in the tooltip

**Expected**

The link in the tooltip that appears on hover â€‹opens in a browser
