## MM-T5759: Channel banner legible when displayed with server-wide announcement, bookmarks bar

---

**Step 1**

1\. Under channel drop-down menu, select Channel Settings and click Configuration in the modal's left nav\
2\. Click toggle to enable Channel Banner\
3\. Enter any text in the text field\
4\. Click Save and close the modal, observe the channel banner above center channel\
5\. Add a bookmark to cause the bookmarks bar to appear: Channel name drop-down > Bookmarks bar > Add a link\
6\. Observe the bookmarks bar displays above the channel banner, just the width of the channel, and both are legible\
6\. Add a system-wide announcement banner: System Console > Site Configuration > System-wide notifications\
7\. Return to channel view and observe the system-wide banner across the very top, full-width\
8\. Bookmarks ​bar and channel banner are still across the top of the channel\
9\. Add enough posts in the channel to scroll

**Expected**

Channel content scrolls ​behind the channel banner and bookmarks bar, and the system-wide banner at the very top is still legible as well
