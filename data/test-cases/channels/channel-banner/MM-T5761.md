## MM-T5761: Mobile: Channel banner text is truncated if it exceeds the available width

---

**Step 1**

On webapp as admin:\
1\. Under channel drop-down menu, select Channel Settings and click Configuration in the modal's left nav\
2\. Click toggle to enable Channel Banner\
3\. Enter long text in the text field that includes a link, such as:\
\
This text will be long enough to truncate on most regular browser widths, and definitely if RHS is open or browser is narrowed. On hover the entirety will appear in a tooltip. \[This link to Github]\(https\://github.com/mattermost) will open in a browser, even when clicked from the tooltip.\
\
4\. Click Save and close the modal\
\
5\. On mobile app: Navigate to channel and observe the channel banner above center channel, with the text truncated and an ellipsis at the end to indicate it's truncated\
5\. Tap the banner and observe the entirety of the text appearing in a sheet from the bottom of the screen\
6\. Tap the link in the tooltip

**Expected**

Tapping the banner shows the full text in a bottom sheet, and tapping the link opens it in a browser
