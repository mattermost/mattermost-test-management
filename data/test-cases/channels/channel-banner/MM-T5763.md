## MM-T5763: Mobile: Channel banner legible when displayed with server-wide announcement, bookmarks bar

---

**Step 1**

On webapp as admin:

1\. Under channel drop-down menu, select Channel Settings and click Configuration in the modal's left nav\
2\. Click toggle to enable Channel Banner\
3\. Enter any text in the text field\
4\. Click Save and close the modal, observe the channel banner above center channel\
5\. Add a bookmark to cause the bookmarks bar to appear: Channel name drop-down > Bookmarks bar > Add a link\
6\. Observe the bookmarks bar displays above the channel banner, just the width of the channel\
7\. Add a system-wide announcement banner: System Console > Site Configuration > System-wide notifications

8\. On mobile app: Navigate to server and observe system-wide banner at top above team name\
9\. Navigate to channel and observe the channel banner above center channel, along with bookmarks bar\
8\. Ensure there are enough posts in the channel to scroll, and scroll the content up and down behind both

7\. Return to channel view and observe the system-wide banner across the very top, full-width\
8\. Bookmarks bar and channel banner are still across the top of the channel\
9\. Add enough posts in the channel to scroll

**Expected**

On mobile, system-wide banner appears in channel list view, not channel view.\
In channel view, channel banner and bookmarks bar both appear and are legible. Channel content should be able to scroll up and down behind.
