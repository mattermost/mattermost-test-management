---

**Step 1**

1. Login into mattermost.
2. Create 2 teams and have users assigned to them.
3. Create a GM channel with users between 2 to 7, and they should be from different team.
4. From the Channel menu, click on 'Convert to Private Channel'.
5. Verify user can see a pop up, with a heading `Convert to Private Channel` and an alert message `Unable to convert to a channel because group members are part of different teams`.
