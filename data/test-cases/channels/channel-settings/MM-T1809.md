## MM-T1809: After adding user to channel, other user should no longer see that user available to add to that same channel

---

**Step 1**

If you just completed the ^above test, you can just carry on and verify without making any more changes:\
1\. Have user2 open that channel drop-down > Add Members\
\
(Or if not, to start test from scratch:\
1\. View the same channel as two different users in two different browsers\
2\. You (user1) add a third user to the channel (channel drop-down > Add Members)\
3\. Then have user2 open that channel drop-down > Add Members)

**Expected**

User2 does not see user3 listed as available to add to the channel.\
\
Refresh is not necessary to view the accurately updated list
