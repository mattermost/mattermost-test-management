## MM-T2690: Search by Position in User Lists

---

**Step 1**

1\. In Profile > Profile Settings > Position, add a position to two test accounts and Save.\
2\. Search for the test accounts, by POSITION, in the following lists:\\

- Sidebar Menu > View/Manage Members
- Channel drop down menu > Add Members
- Channel drop down menu > View/Manage Members
- "More..." at the bottom of your direct message list

<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-5881>

_Important notes about this step:_

Searching for users by position shouldn't work on the message autocomplete or on the search :from modifier, since it's not visible on the UI.

**Expected**

Results are displayed for the users based on "Position" field info
