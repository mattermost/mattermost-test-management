## MM-T3658: Automatically disable channel wide mentions when a user mutes a channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to a channel that is NOT muted
2. In the center panel, to the right of a channel name, click on the dropdown arrow
3. Click "Notification Preferences"
4. Set "Mute Channel" to "On" and click "Save"

**Expected**

"Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all" setting is automatically toggled to "On" after muting the channel
