## MM-T837: Device sync when creating channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Have the \*same account\* viewing the same team open in two different devices (can be two browsers, desktop app, RN, mobile app)
2. In one of them create a public channel using the `+` icon in LHS

**Expected**

The channel appears in the left hand sidebar for all devices as soon it gets created in the other device
