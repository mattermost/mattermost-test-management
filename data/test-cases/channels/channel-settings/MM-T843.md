## MM-T843: Not able to reply to a message from the RHS once removed from the channel

---

**Step 1**

1. Log in as two test users and navigate to the same channel for each user
2. User A click on reply icon on a post to open the RHS
3. User A leaves RHS open and navigates to another channel in the center panel
4. User B removes User A from the channel that is open in the RHS in 2)

[Able to reply to a post from RHS after being removed from a channel â€” MM-14198](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14198)

_Important notes about this step:_

RHS will only close if the thread or pinned posts being viewed are for the channel the user was removed from. In all other instances the RHS should remain open.

**Expected**

- RHS should close if it's open to a thread from the channel they were just removed from
