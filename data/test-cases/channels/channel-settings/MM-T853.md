## MM-T853: RN apps: Can add members to channel / deactivated user does not appear in list to add

---

**Step 1**

**First**: Deactivate another user or make a note of a user you know is deactivated\\

1. View a channel you can add users to, and tap the channel name to open the menu
2. Note the number of channel members next to Manage Members
3. Tap on "Add members", observe the list of users on the server who can be added

_Related ticket(s):_

- [RN: Deactivated users show on "Add Members" (to channel) modal but not on the search results — MM-13418](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13418)
- [Deactivated users are not showing in user search bar while adding them in a channel — MM-25807](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-25807)

**Expected**

- Verify deactivated user does NOT appear in this list

---

**Step 2**

Add a member:\\

1. With the user list still open from the above step:
2. Tap on "Search", keyboard opens
3. Type in the name of the user to be added, observe list filters to match what you typed
4. Tap on the circle to the left of the user's name, it appears selected
5. Tap on "add" at the top right of the screen

**Expected**

- The user should be added to the channel
- Total number of members next to "manage members" menu option should increase by the number of users added to the channel
- System message should display in the channel showing which members were added to the channel.
