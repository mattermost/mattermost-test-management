## MM-T858: Combined join/leave messages in public channel

---

**Step 1**

Combined join/leave messages in public channel:

- Combines until there is an intervening post
- Multiple users in one type of action displays an "others" link the user can click to see full list of users

Combined messages are listed in a fixed order based on action type, regardless of the order in which they happened:

- Joined
- Was added
- Left
- Was removed

\--------------------\
You'll need 5 test users you can add/remove, but you only need to be able to log in as one of them (user4 in step 4):\
\\

1. Add any 3 users to a public channel (we'll call them user1, user2, user3)
2. Observe system message " and 2 others were added to the channel by you", and "and 2 others" is a link (but don't click it yet, or if you already did, refresh to re-collapse it)
3. Remove one of ^those users from the channel (user1)
4. Have yet another user (not one of the above) log in in another browser and join that channel themselves (user4)
5. Post a message in the channel to interrupt the join/leave messages
6. You add yet another user (not one of the above users) to the channel (user5)

**Expected**

Observe the following three posts\
(how the username/first-last/nickname displays can vary based on Account Settings, but they should at least combine in this way):

1. System

   - @user4 joined the channel
   - @user1 and 2 others were added to the channel by you
   - <2 others is a link that shows the others when clicked: user2, user3>
   - @user1 (or 2 or 3) was removed from the channel.

2. \<the test message you posted>

3. System

   - @user5 added to the channel by you.
