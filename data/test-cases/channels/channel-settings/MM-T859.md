## MM-T859: Join/leave messages (including combined): Usernames are links, open profile popovers

---

**Step 1**

Join/leave messages (including combined): Usernames are links, open profile popovers\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
Can use join/leave messages produced in previous test, if done, or add at least three users to a channel to get a combined message.\\

1. On a single join or leave message (not combined with other users), click the username link

---

**Step 2**

1. On a combined join or leave message that includes a link such as "and 2 others", click to expand the usernames, then click each username link

**Expected**

- The user's profile popover displays when their username is clicked, and the popover is fully visible
