## MM-T881: Header - Markdown quote

---

**Step 1**

1. Click channel name ➜ Edit Channel Header (for mobile, you must tap Edit Channel from the channel info screen)
2. Add / edit header to start with a quote, such as the following, and save:
   \
   \> This is a quote in the header

_Important notes about this step:_

**RN Apps**: Tap channel name to view channel info and should see markdown quotes indicator with text

**Expected**

- Quotes icon should be fully visible, not cut off, then followed by as much of the text as will fit (depending on the width of the window)
- **RN Apps**: Tap channel name to view channel info and should see markdown quotes indicator with text

---

**Step 2**

1. Copy the channel header info from a channel you are able to edit
2. Add a markdown image to the start of the text — i.e., **!\[Alt text]\(Image\_URL)** — and paste it into the channel header of a test channel you've set up
