## MM-T882: Channel URL validation works properly

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to any channel that is not Town Square which you have permission to rename (and want to change the URL for)
2. Click "v" next to the channel name in the header, then choose "Rename Channel"
3. Edit the URL part to "town-square"
4. Hit "Save"
5. Update the URL to any other new value and Save

**Expected**

- On 3, an error is shown as "Unable to update the channel."
- Channel URL successfully updated without error message.
