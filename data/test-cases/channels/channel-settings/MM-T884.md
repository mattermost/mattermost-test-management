## MM-T884: Channel name validates against two user IDs being used in URL

---

**Step 1**

Renaming channel name validates against two user IDs being used in URL\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Create a new channel with a URL that contains `\_\_` (**2 underscores**) in it
2. Ensure that the channel is valid and can be created
3. Attempt to rename a channel URL to: uzsfmtmniifsjgesce4u7yznyh\_\_uzsfmtmniifsjgesce5u7yznyh
   \
   (**two 26 character strings with 2 underscores between them**)

_Related ticket(s):_

- [Channels can be created with userid\_\_userid in rc.test — MM-21509](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21509)
- (Won't Fix) [Using UserID should not be allowed in channel names — MM-22319](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22319)
- [Web: Change URL field on Rename Channel modal allows more then 2 underscores — MM-23727](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23727)

_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: A single underscore is allowed as it doesn't conflict with DM names which contain 2 underscores.

**Expected**

- Channel url is invalid and that the relevant error message is returned
