## MM-T884: Channel name validates against two user IDs being used in URL

---

**Step 1**

Renaming channel name validates against two user IDs being used in URL

1. Create a new channel with a URL that contains `__` (**2 underscores**) in it
2. Ensure that the channel is valid and can be created
3. Attempt to rename a channel URL to: `uzsfmtmniifsjgesce4u7yznyh__uzsfmtmniifsjgesce5u7yznyh`
   \
   (**two 26 character strings with 2 underscores between them**)

_Related ticket(s):_

- [Add missing `__` check to channel renaming — MM-21336](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21336)
- [Channels can be created with `userid__userid` in rc.test — MM-21509](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21509)
- (Won't Fix) [Using UserID should not be allowed in channel names — MM-22319](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22319)
- [Web: Change URL field on Rename Channel modal allows more then 2 underscores — MM-23727](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23727)

_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: A single underscore is allowed as it doesn't conflict with DM names which contain 2 underscores.

**Expected**

- Channel url is invalid and that the relevant error message is returned

**Step 2**

Creating new channel validates against two user IDs being used as channel name

1. Attempt to create a channel with the channel name: `uzsfmtmniifsjgesce4u7yznyh__uzsfmtmniifsjgesce5u7yznyh`

**Expected**

- Channel name is invalid and that the relevant error message is returned "Channel names can't be in a hexadecimal format. Please enter a different channel name."

**Step 3**

Creating a new channel validates against gm-like names being used as channel name

1. Click on create public channel

   1. Verify that the new channel modal is visible

2. Add the new channel name with invalid name and press Create Channel e.g. `71b03afcbb2d503d49f87f057549c43db4e19f92`

   1. Assert the error occurred with the appropriate message " Channel names can't be in a hexadecimal format. Please enter a different channel name."

3. Close the create channel modal

**Expected**

- Channel name is invalid and the relevant error message is returned
