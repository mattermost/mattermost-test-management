## MM-T888: Channel sidebar: More unreads (webapp)

---

**Step 1**

**With enough channels in the LHS to scroll**:

1. Ensure Settings > Sidebar does NOT have Unreads section enabled (or test on server that doesn't have that feature enabled to begin with)
2. Have another user post messages in a channel near the top of your channel list
3. Scroll LHS down and observe "More unreads" (RN apps have an up arrow instead of "above")
4. Click the indicator and observe it scrolls the LHS up
5. Have another user post in a channel near the bottom (or a DM)
6. Scroll LHS up and observe "More unreads" indicator
7. Click the indicator and observe it scrolls the LHS down

**Expected**

- Clicking the unreads indicator should scroll your LHS so it's positioned a little bit (15px) past the channel with the unreads
