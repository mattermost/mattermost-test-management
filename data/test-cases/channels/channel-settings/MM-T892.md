## MM-T892: Leave a channel while multiple other tabs are open to different channels

---

**Step 1**

1. Log on to a server on a browser and view a channel you want to leave
2. Open multiple additional tabs, each viewing a different channel on that server
3. Go back to the first tab, click channel name drop-down and select `Leave Channel`

**Expected**

- Only the tab viewing the channel you left is redirected to whatever channel you had previously been viewing on that tab.
- Other tabs do not redirect; they continue to display the channel you had been viewing on each tab (the channels you did not leave)
