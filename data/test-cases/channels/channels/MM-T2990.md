## MM-T2990: LHS channel scroll, list should not scroll if channel is still visible

---

**Step 1**

1\) Have enough channels in the sidebar that there are at least 2 screens worth of channels\
2\) Switch to one of the channels near the top of the sidebar\
3\) Scroll the sidebar to the top\
4\) Click on one of the last few channels on the screen

**Expected**

You're not scrolled in the LHS, since the channel is still visible
