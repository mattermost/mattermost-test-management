## MM-T3827: Find Channels modal should focus first result

---

**Step 1**

Find Channels modal should focus first result\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Open Find Channels modal (ctrl/cmd+k)
2. Type a partial search term, something you know will return few results\
   i) Verify first item is focused
3. Use backspace to delete the last character added\
   i) Verify first item is focused after backspacing
4. Hover over one of the results (or use arrow keys to move from the top result); use backspace again\
   i) Verify first item is in focus after backspace

**Expected**

At step 2. > First item in the results list should be in focus\
At step 3. > First item in the results list should remain in focus when backspacing\
At step 4. > Mouse hover and keyboard arrows selection of the result does not keep the focus after backspace is used and will jump focus back to top result
