## MM-T3932: Show user status in Find Channels modal

---

**Step 1**

_Show user status in Find Channels modal_

1. Open Find Channels modal using cmd+K

2. Search for some DMs

   1. Verify user status is displayed on user's profile picture

3. Search for user you haven't DM previously

   1. Verify, when undefined, user status is not displayed on the avatar

**Expected**

- Find Channels modal displays user status information on the avatar
- When undefined, user status is not loaded; in that case status will not be displayed on the avatar on the Find Channels modal
