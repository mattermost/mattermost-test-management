## MM-T3989: Slow Typing test

---

**Step 1**

Slow Typing investigation

1. Setup an environment with a steady state of background activity triggering websocket updates (i.e. other users posting on a semi-regular cadence to channels in which the user is a member)

2. Open 20+ DMs or GMs (the more, the easier this is to reproduce)

3. Test typing while this background activity is occurring

   1. Verify there is no delay between user typing and text rendering on the screen

**Expected**

- Verify there is no delay between user typing on the keyboard and text rendering in the textbox
