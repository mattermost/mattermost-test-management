## MM-T5423: LHS Add Channels CTA

**Objective**

Ensure proper functionality of the LHS Add Channels CTA for users depending upon permission settings

- Permission enabled to create Public and/or Private channels
- Permission disabled to create Public and Private channels

---

**Step 1**

1. As an admin ensure that regular users are able to create public and/or private channels in the settings at `System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permissions`
2. As a regular user click the `Add Channels` CTA on the LHS which should display a small menu with 2 items on it

- `Create new channel` - which opens the `Create a new channel` modal when clicked on
- `Browse channels` - which opens the `More channels` modal when clicked

1. As the admin disable the creation of **both** Public and Private channels for regular users
2. As the regular user click the `Add Channels` CTA on the LHS which should open the `More channels` modal directly and not display any menu under the CTA
