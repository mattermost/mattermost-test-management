## MM-T889: RN apps: Channel sidebar - More unreads

---

**Step 1**

**With enough channels in the channel drawer to make it scrollable**:

1. Have another user post messages in channel(s) until you can scroll unread channels off the top of the screen
2. Scroll LHS down and observe "⇡ More unreads"

3. Tap the indicator and observe it scrolls the channel list up
4. updated below:
5. Tap on the top unread channel, open the LHS and repeat steps 4 - 6 until all unread channels are now read and do it one more time selecting the first read channel in the list.

[Mobile: More unreads overlay partially occlude’s the top most channel from user interaction. — MM-18997](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18997)\
<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22945>

_Important notes about this step:_

For RN apps, the "more unreads below" indicator was not implemented; just "above". (It is possible it will be implemented later with channel sidebar re-org)

**Expected**

- Tapping the indicator scrolls the channel list so unread channels are at the top
- It should always take you to the channel
