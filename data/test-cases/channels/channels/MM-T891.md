## MM-T891: RN apps: Scroll up in channel with long history

---

**Step 1**

In a channel with a long message history (such as Developers on community-release.mattermost.com):

1. Swipe repeatedly to scroll message list and load more messages (do this for quite a while; at least 10 or so batches of messages loaded)
2. After loading more messages many times in a row, tap hamburger icon and switch channels a couple times

_Related ticket(s):_

(Won't Fix) [RN: Scroll issues â€” MM-12191](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-12191)

**Expected**

- A set of more messages should load automatically each time the top of the list is reached
- Hamburger icon should still be responsive, and channel switching should still be fast after loading all those messages
