**Step 1**

Disregard  Reply notification settings if CRT is on

1. Go to Settings>Notifications> Reply notifications select 1st option: Trigger notifications on messages in reply threads that I start or participate in
2. Save
3. Receive a reply on a thread you started in 
   1. Verify notification is received 
4. Go to Settings> Display>Collapsed Reply Threads and set to ON
5. Save
6. Go to Settings>Notifications>Desktop Notification>Thread reply notifications and uncheck Notify me about threads I'm following 
7. Save
8. Receive a reply on a thread you started 
   1. Verify you are not notified

**Expected**

Verify previous reply notification setting is ignored after CRT has been enabled for a user
