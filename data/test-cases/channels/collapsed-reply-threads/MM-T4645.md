## MM-T4645: CRT - thread is auto-followed when user is mentioned and added to channel

---

**Step 1**

_Thread is auto-followed when user is added to channel_

1. Mention user-1 in a thread in a channel that user-1 is not already a member of

2. Click the link in the ephemeral message in the RHS to add user-1 to the channel

3. Observe as user-1

   1. Verify User-1 is auto-following the thread - there should be a **mention badge on global threads + bolding** on both, the channel sidebar item and the Threads sidebar item.

**Expected**

User is autofollowing the thread - there should be a **mention badge on global threads + bolding** on global thread item and channel sidebar item.
