1. Â Open the threads view

2. Open the Find Channels modal (CTRL/CMD + K)

3. Use the up/down arrow keys to move through the list on channels

   1. Verify find channels modal is capturing the arrow keys and not the background

**Expected**

The arrow keys are captured by the find channel modal since it's in the foreground
