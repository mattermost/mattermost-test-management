---

**Step 1**

Show guidance at the end of the global threads list

1. Create more than 25 threads so we can use scroll loading in the Threads list

2. Scroll load the threads list to reach the end

3. Search guidance item should be shown at the end of the threads list

4. Title, subtitle and shortcut keys should be shown

   1. Verify "That's the end of the list" text within guidance graphic at the bottom of the list

**Expected**

The Search guidance item is shown at the bottom of the Threads list.
