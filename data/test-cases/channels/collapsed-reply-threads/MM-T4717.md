   1. Verify for User1 this channel is **not** bolded
   2. Verify channel item **doesn't** have mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge
   5. Verify main channel root post **doesn't** have a thread footer and **no** unread dot
   6. Verify **no** new messages line on the channel

2. Login as User2 with no current unread threads

   1. Verify Off Topic is bolded
   2. Verify channel item has a mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge

3. Click on Off Topic to open

   1. Verify Off topic is **no** longer bolded
   2. Verify Off topic **no** longer has a mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify main channel post **doesn't** have a thread footer and **no** unread dot
   5. Verify new messages line above the post
