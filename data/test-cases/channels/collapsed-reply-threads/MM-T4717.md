   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge
   5. Verify main channel root post **doesn't** have a thread footer and **no** unread dot
   6. Verify **no** new messages line on the channel

2. Login as User2 with no current unread threads

   1. Verify Off Topic is bolded
   2. Verify channel item has a mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge
