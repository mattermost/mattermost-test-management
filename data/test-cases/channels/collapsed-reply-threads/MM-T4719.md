   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge
   5. Verify main channel root post **doesn't** have a thread footer and **no** unread dot
   6. Verify **no** new messages line on the channel

2.  Login as User2 and mark Off topic as read

3. As User2 switch to different channel

   1. Verify Off topic is **not** bolded

4. As User1 add replies to post from step 1.
