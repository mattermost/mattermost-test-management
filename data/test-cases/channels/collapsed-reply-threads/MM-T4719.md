**Step 1**

_Open an unfollowed thread_

   1. Verify for User1 this channel is **not** bolded
   2. Verify channel item **doesn't** have mention badge
   3. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   4. Verify global threads item **doesn't** have mention badge
   5. Verify main channel root post **doesn't** have a thread footer and **no** unread dot
   6. Verify **no** new messages line on the channel

2.  Login as User2 and mark Off topic as read

3. As User2 switch to different channel

   1. Verify Off topic is **not** bolded

4. As User1 add replies to post from step 1.

   1. Verify, for user1, root post has a thread footer, Following and **no** unread dot

5. As User2 click on Off Topic to open 

   1. Verify Off topic is **not** bolded
   2. Verify global threads item is **not** bolded
   3. Verify main channel post from step one has a thread footer, Follow and **no** unread dot
   4. Verify **no** new messages line above the root post

6. Click on the root post to open on RHS
