## MM-T4986: CRT: Marking a thread as unread from the threads list should mark only the most recent message as unread

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to the ‘Threads’ view
2. Find a read thread in the list of threads
3. Click on the ••• icon on that thread item in the list
4. Click ‘Mark as unread’

**Expected**

Unread from the threads list marks only the most recent message as unread and new message line is moved above it.
