1. Mattermost server with valid license to support "Custom Profile Attributes" feature
2. Admin has created Website custom profile attribute with URL validation
3. Test user has Website value set to "<https://example.com>"

---

**Step 1**

Verify that URL validation works properly for custom profile attributes, showing errors for invalid URLs and allowing valid ones.

2. Open profile settings
3. Edit Website field and enter an invalid URL "ftp\://invalid-url"
4. Try to save the changes
5. Observe error message
6. Edit Website field and enter a valid URL "<https://example2.com>"

**Expected**

- Save button doesn't complete the operation with invalid URL
- Valid URL saves successfully with no error message
