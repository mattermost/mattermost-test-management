## MM-T5774: Do Not Display Custom Profile Attributes If None Exist

**Precondition**

1. A test server with valid license to support 'Custom Profile Attributes'
2. Admin has created custom profile attributes (Department, Location, Title, Phone, Website)
3. A user exists who has no values set for any custom profile attributes
4. Two user accounts exist and are members of the same channel

---

**Step 1**

Verify that custom profile attributes are not displayed in the profile popover if the user has no values set.

1. Login as a user with no custom profile attribute values
2. Go to a channel where the user is a member
3. Post a message to make the user visible in the channel
4. Open the profile popover for the user's post

**Expected**

- No custom profile attributes are displayed in the profile popover
- The profile popover displays only standard user information (username, status, etc.)
- The absence of custom attributes doesn't affect the overall appearance of the popover
