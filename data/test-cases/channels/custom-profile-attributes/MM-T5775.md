## MM-T5775: Update Custom Profile Attributes When Changed

**Precondition**

1. A test server with valid license to support 'Custom Profile Attributes'

2. Admin has created custom profile attributes (Department, Location, Title, etc.)

3. Test user has values set for custom profile attributes:

   - Department: Engineering
   - Location: Remote

4. User is a member of a channel

---

**Step 1**

Verify that custom profile attributes are updated correctly when changed and the changes are reflected in the profile popover.

1. Login as the test user

2. Go to a channel where the user is a member

3. Post a message to make the user visible in the channel

4. Open the profile popover for the user's post

5. Verify the current attribute values are displayed correctly

6. Close the profile popover

7. Update the user's custom profile attributes:

   - Change Department from "Engineering" to "Product"
   - Change Location from "Remote" to "Office"

8. Open the profile popover again

**Expected**

- Updated custom profile attributes are displayed correctly in the profile popover
- Department shows the new value "Product"
- Location shows the new value "Office"
- Non-updated attributes still display their original values correctly
