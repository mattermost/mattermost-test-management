## MM-T2186: Emoji picker - default and custom emoji reaction, case-insensitive

---

**Step 1**

Emoji picker - default and custom emoji reaction, case-insensitive\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Make sure the server has custom emoji enabled and at least one created\
2\. Make a post\
3\. React to that post with a built in emoji by typing "+:TAco:"\
4\. React again to that post by clicking emoji picker, typing the first three letters of the custom emoji name in search, and clicking the custom emoji\
5\. Refresh the page

**Expected**

Emoji search is not case-sensitive\
\
Custom emoji renders properly in reaction, along with built-in emoji\
\
Emoji render properly before and after refresh
