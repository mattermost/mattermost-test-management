## MM-T2221: Emoji picker category does not display when filtered

---

**Step 1**

Emoji picker category does not display when filtered\
————————————————————————————\
1\) The order should follow the order in emoji picker, i.e. "People" emoji first, followed by "Nature", "Food", etc.\
2\) Recently used emoji shouldn't be included in the list, to avoid having the same emoji twice.\
3\) At the header of the emoji picker, the "Recently Used" section should be highlighted when doing the search.

**Expected**
