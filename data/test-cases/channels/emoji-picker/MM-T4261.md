## MM-T4261: One-click reactions on a post

---

**Step 1**

_One-Click Reactions_

1. Ensure emoji picker is enabled in System console

2. Create a post and hover over post menu

   1. Verify One click reactions are **not** part of the post menu on hover

3. Toggle One-click reactions option in Account Settings>Display>One-click reactions on messages to ON

4. Hover over the post menu

   1. Verify One click reactions are part of the post menu on hover
   2. Verify +1, grinning and white check mark are 3 default emoji shown

5. Open the same post in RHS and hover over the post

   1. Verify only one emoji is part of the post menu, +1

6. Click on Expand Sidebar to expand RHS

   1. Verify all 3 default emoji are part of the post menu on hover

7. React to post with new emoji e.g "wave" 

8. Hover over post again

   1. Verify most recent emoji is shown slotted in the 1st place, pushing white check mark emoji out

9. Use 2 more new emoji reactions (other then default) on the same post and hover 

   1. Verify 3 most recent emoji are shown as one click reaction options, with the last used in the 1st slot and all default emoji have been pushed out, no longer visible.

10. Use :wave: reaction again few times on different posts

    1. Verify :wave: is sorted on the left as most frequently used

11. Use +1 reaction again

    1. Verify :wave: is still in the far left spot as the most frequently used reaction

**Expected**

- One click reactions are part of the post menu on hover with  +1, grinning and white check mark being the starting 3 default emoji
- New reactions will push default reactions out, but will not replace the most frequently use reactions.
- RHS should show only one most recent reaction option on menu hover, shows 3 when expanded

**Step 2**

_One-Click Reactions setting with Emoji Picker OFF_

1. Navigate to System Console>Site Configuration>Emoji>Enable Emoji Picker, set it to FALSE and save

2. Open Account Settings > Display

   1. Verify One-click reactions on messages option is not available 

3. Create a post and hover to reveal post menu 

   1. Verify one click reactions are not shown on the post menu

**Expected**

- When Emoji Picker is set to FALSE one-click reaction setting is not available in the Account Settings>Display and one-click reactions are not shown on the post menu
