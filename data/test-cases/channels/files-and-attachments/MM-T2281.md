## MM-T2281: Draft in different channel while large files uploading in first channel

---

**Step 1**

Draft in different channel while large files uploading in first channel\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Go to channel 1, start uploading a couple large files\
2\. Before the uploads can finish, switch to another channel, and start typing a draft message\
3\. Wait a reasonable amount of time for the files in the first channel to finish uploading

**Expected**

\- The current channel draft does not show any attachments\
\- The first channel shows the attachments uploaded on the draft message
