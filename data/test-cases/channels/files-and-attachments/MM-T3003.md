## MM-T3003: RN apps: ANDROID ONLY - Can leave team from webapp with mobile app open, and share extension displays error messaging as expected

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create a new user from the webapp.\
2\. Sign in to the user on the mobile app, and join a team.\
3\. While the mobile app is open, leave the team on the webapp.\
4\. Close the mobile app.\
5\. Try and use the share extension to share a file using the mobile app.

**Expected**

The prompt explaining that I can't share a file without belonging to a team displays.\
\
Note: If I were to open Mattermost at that point, I should see the team selection page.
