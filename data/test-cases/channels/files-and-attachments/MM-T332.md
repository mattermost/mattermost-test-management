**Step 1**

Image link preview - Bitly links for images and YouTube\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

2. In a test channel, post the following **in 2 separate posts**:

   - **YouTube bitly link**: https\://bit.ly/2NlYsOr
   - **Image bitly link**: https\://bit.ly/2wqEbjw

3. Click on the "collapse" arrow of the image preview to close it

4. Click on the "expand" arrow to open the preview again

**Notes**:

- The YouTube preview will not expand or collapse
- Steps 3 and 4 are N/A for RN

**Mobile app**

- Tapping the bit.ly link on Mobile will launch a browser and play the video there
