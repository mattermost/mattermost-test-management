## MM-T334: Drag and Drop - Error message expected when trying to drop a folder

---

**Step 1**

Drag and Drop - Error message when trying to drop a folder\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Drag and drop a folder into a Mattermost channel in the center
2. Open a thread in the RHS that is long enough to scroll up in so you don't see the message input box
3. Drag and drop a folder into the RHS

_Related ticket(s):_

[Drag/Dropping a folder should scroll the user to the RHS text box so the error is visible — MM-17537](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17537)

_Important notes about this step:_

You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

- Error message saying "Folders cannot be uploaded. Please drag all files separately"
- In the RHS, make sure you are automatically scrolled to the bottom and can see the error message.
