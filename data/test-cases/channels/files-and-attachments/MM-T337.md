## MM-T337: CTRL/CMD+U - Five files on one message, thumbnails while uploading

---

**Step 1**

CTRL/CMD+U - Five files on one message, thumbnails while uploading\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. With focus in the center message box
2. Press CTRL+U (Windows) or CMD+U (macOS) (You may need to disable Onelogin Chrome extension to test this)
3. Select 5 image files over 640x480 for upload
4. Click in dialog or press ENTER to begin uploading
5. As files upload, observe the uploading thumbnails

_Important notes about this step:_

You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

- As files are uploading, after the first 3 or so have finished uploading (enough to push others off to the right), you can scroll horizontally to view the still-uploading files
- All files complete uploading and can be posted by pressing ENTER
