## MM-T341: Download link on preview - Image file (non-SVG)

---

**Step 1**

Download link on preview - Image file (non-SVG; that's tested separately with Chrome and mobile browser)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Click the thumbnail of a non-SVG image attachment to open the previewer
2. Click the "Download" link in the previewer

_Important notes about this step:_

- FF may prompt you to ask what you'd like to do with the file but may follow the setting you previously set for files of that type.
- Chrome downloads file. In my tests, iOS Classic opens the image and Android Classic downloads the file. IE11 may ask whether you want to open or save the file.

**Expected**

- Image should download
