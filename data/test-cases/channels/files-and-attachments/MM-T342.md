**Step 2**

2. View that channel in the mobile app
3. Observe the image is not animated in channel view
4. Tap the image to view it in image viewer

_Important notes about this step:_

Note: Updated May 2020 to reflect that animation in-channel was reverted in <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/4084> and the animation occurs only after tapping the image to view.
