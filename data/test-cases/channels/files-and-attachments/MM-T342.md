_Important notes about this step:_

You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

- Both the link preview thumbnail and the embedded/inline image appear animated

---

**Step 2**

1. From the desktop, upload an animated gif as a file attachment and post it in a channel
2. View that channel in the mobile app
3. Observe the image is not animated in channel view
4. Tap the image to view it in image viewer

- [animated gif shows in channel as a broken icon — MM-31200](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-31200)

_Important notes about this step:_

Note: Updated May 2020 to reflect that animation in-channel was reverted in <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/4084> and the animation occurs only after tapping the image to view.

**Expected**

- GIFs appears animated only after tapping to open the image
