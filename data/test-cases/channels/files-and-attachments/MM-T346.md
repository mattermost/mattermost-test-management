## MM-T346: Public link related to a deleted post should no longer open the file

---

**Step 1**

Public link related to a deleted post should no longer open the file\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Make a post with any file attached
2. Click on the attachment thumbnail to open the preview
3. Click on "Get public link", click "copy link" then click "close"
4. Delete the post you made in step 2
5. In another browser tab, paste and navigate to the link

_Important notes about this step:_

- Public File Links must be "True" (in System Console ➜ Security ➜ Public Links), which already should be true on the test server
- You can find test files here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xGCy3tp9A_WxOfdgAzBHzrqJ1WCyfSjW>

**Expected**

You should see an error displayed "_Error, Unable to get the file info, Back to Mattermost_"
