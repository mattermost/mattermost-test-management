1. Attach a PDF file and post

2. Click on the PDF to open Preview

   2. Verify user can drag both vertical and horizontal scroll bars

4. Click on reset

- Scroll bars should be visible in both, light and dark themes when zoomed in enough to trigger the scroll bars and can be dragged
- Zoom options are not available when previewing files that do not support zooming.
