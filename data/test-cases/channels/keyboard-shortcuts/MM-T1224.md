2. Type the first letter of another user's username (who you don't already have a DM channel open with, but who you can log in as) in the "Switch Channels" modal message box
3. Scroll down to the "Other Channels" section and locate the user
4. Use your mouse to choose the user and open the DM channel
5. Send a DM
6. Log in as the other user

On 4, DM channel with that user opens (no Javascript errors), with focus in the message box.\
On 5, Other user receives the DM.
