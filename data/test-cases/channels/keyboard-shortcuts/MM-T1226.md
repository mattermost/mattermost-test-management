## MM-T1226: CTRL/CMD+K - Find GM by matching username, full name, or nickname, even if that name isn't displayed

---

**Step 1**

CTRL/CMD+K - Find GM by matching username, full name, or nickname, even if that name isn't displayed\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Ensure there is a GM open that includes at least one user with full name and nickname set

2. Press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (Mac)

3. Depending on teammate name display settings, filter the list to find the GM by \*searching on a term that is not displayed\*\
   \
   In other words, if you have a GM that includes user `@username, Firstname Lastname, nickname`, and display is set to show username:

   - Press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (Mac)
   - Type `nic` or `las`
   - You should see the GM with @username come up as a search result
