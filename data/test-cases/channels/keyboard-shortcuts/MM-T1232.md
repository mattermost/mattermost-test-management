## MM-T1232: ALT+SHIFT+DOWN

---

**Step 1**

ALT+SHIFT+DOWN\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Ensure there are at least two public channels, two private channels and one direct message channel created and visible on the left hand sidebar
2. Ensure there is at least one public channel, one private channel and one direct message channel created and listed under FAVORITE CHANNELS
3. Go to Town Square (or its equivalent).
4. Use a second account to post a message in one public channel (not Town Square), one private channel and one direct message channel, which are visible on the left hand sidebar. Repeat for channels under FAVORITE CHANNELS header.
5. Check to make sure the channels on the left hand sidebar are bolded indicating unread messages
6. Press ALT+SHIFT+DOWN four times and monitor behaviour in the left hand sidebar

**Expected**

- Each time a user presses ALT+SHIFT+DOWN, they navigate to a channel immediately below the current channel in the left hand sidebar with unread messages.
- If the current channel is at the very bottom of the left hand sidebar, ALT+SHIFT+DOWN brings the user to the top of the channel list in the left hand sidebar with unread messages
- Once there are no unread channels, ALT+SHIFT+DOWN does nothing.
- This should hold for favourite channels as well
