## MM-T1234: CTRL/CMD+K Setup for following tests Display order of search results

---

**Step 1**

CTRL/CMD+K\
\
Setup for following tests\
\
Display order of search results\
\--------------------\
On a team with enough channels to observe alphabetical order (with some channels that have the first letter in common):\
\
1\. Ensure there are also GMs and DMs that can start with the same letter, or create GM channels and/or users if needed\
2\. Press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (Mac)\
3\. Type the first letter in the "Switch Channels" modal message box

**Expected**

\- Channels are ordered by channels, DMs and GMs you belong to listed first\
\
\- Results that \*begin\* with the letter you searched on appear (in alpha order) above results that just \*contain\* the letter (then in alpha order again)\
\
\- Each channel type has an appropriate icon next to the channel name: \[globe for public; lock for private; profile picture for DMs and GMs]\
\
\- Display of DM / GMs matches message autocomplete, i.e. "@username - FirstName LastName (Nickname)"\
\
\- Deactivated users appear at the bottom of the user list
