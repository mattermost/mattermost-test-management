## MM-T1241: CTRL/CMD+K: Unreads

---

**Step 1**

CTRL/CMD+K: Unreads\
\--------------------\
1\. Ensure that you have some unread messages / channels, including a couple mentions\
2\. Press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (Mac)\
3\. Observe sorting order (as described ---> )\
4\. After verifying sorting order, type some characters in the filter box, verify filters as expected

**Expected**

Before typing anything in the filter box, any unread channels are displayed and can be switched to\
\
If on multiple teams, unread channels from the other team do NOT display in channel switcher\
\
1\. Any channel type with mentions, in alphabetical order (with mention badge displayed to the right of the channel name)\
2\. Any other channels with regular unreads (not mentions), in alphabetical order\
\
Typing in the filter box filters the list as usual (any unread channels that don't match the filter are no longer listed; unreads are not sorted to the top)
