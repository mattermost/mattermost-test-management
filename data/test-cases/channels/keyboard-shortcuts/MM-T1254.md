## MM-T1254: CTRL/CMD+UP or DOWN at center channel

---

**Step 1**

1\. Refresh the page\
2\. Post five messages in the center channel\
3\. Press CTRL+UP (Windows) or CMD+UP (Mac) repeatedly in the empty input box\
4\. Press CTRL+DOWN (Windows) or CMD+DOWN (Mac) repeatedly in the empty input box

**Expected**

1\. Each time you press CTRL/CMD+UP, a previous message you have posted appears in the text box. Once you have repeated it five times (and reached the end of message history), CTRL/CMD+UP does no action\
2\. Similarly, each time you press CTRL/CMD+DOWN, the next message you have posted appears in the text box.
