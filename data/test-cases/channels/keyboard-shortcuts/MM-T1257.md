## MM-T1257: CTRL/CMD+UP or DOWN in RHS

---

**Step 1**

1. Refresh the page
2. Open the right hand sidebar
3. Post five messages in the right hand sidebar, with the last message being '/shrug'
4. Press CTRL+UP (Windows) or CMD+UP (Mac) repeatedly in the right hand sidebar, then press CTRL/CMD+DOWN
5. In the center channel message box, press CTRL+UP (Windows) or CMD+UP (Mac) once
6. In the center channel message box, press CTRL+DOWN (Windows) or CMD+DOWN (Mac) once

- (Won't Fix) [CTRL/CMD+UP/DOWN should not cycle through deleted messages â€” MM-10081](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10081)
- (Won't Fix; new behavior is more consistent and preferred) [Regression: CMD/CTRL+down can clear out the text input box of the most recent post unexpectedly](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-55653)

**Expected**

On step 4, each time you press CTRL/CMD+UP, a previous message you have posted will appear in the text box on the right hand sidebar. Once you have repeated it five times (and reached the end of message history), CTRL/CMD+UP does no action. CTRL/CMD+DOWN shows next message in succession\
\
On step 5, '/shrug' displays in the center channel text box\
\
On step 6, '/shrug' displays in the center channel text box. Pressing again after that clears the text from the message box.
