## MM-T1575: Ability to Switch Teams (does not apply on Linux)

---

**Step 1**

Note: This does not apply on Linux as the keyboard shortcut combo is already in use for switching workspaces. Okay to skip this test and comment that you're on Linux if that is the case.\\

1. Login as a user and ensure the user has access to more than 10 teams.
2. Use the shortcuts to switch teams (as mentioned in Test Data) and check if the teams are shown appropriately.
3. Access the Keyboard shortcuts from the Main Menu.

**Test Data**

**On Windows:**\
Previous Team - Ctrl + Alt + Up\
Next Team - Ctrl + Alt + Down\
Switch to a specific team - Ctrl + Alt + \[1-9]\
\
**On Mac:**\
Previous Team - Command + Option + Up\
Next Team - Command + Option + Down\
Switch to a specific team - Command + Option + \[1-9]\
\
**Not supported on Linux**This key combo is already used for switching workspaces\
\\

**Expected**

On 2,\\

- Keyboard shortcuts should work correctly
- User should land on the last viewed channel on each team as expected (not random channel)

On 3, check if shortcuts for "Previous Team" "Next Team" and "Switch to a specific team" are displayed in Keyboard shortcuts dialog.
