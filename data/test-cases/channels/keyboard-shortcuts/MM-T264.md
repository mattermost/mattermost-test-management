## MM-T264: Unreads section behavior when using keyboard shortcuts

**Precondition**

Run these tests on <https://community-release.mattermost.com>

Using the old keyboard settings.

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to 'Settings ➜ Sidebar ➜ Sidebar Settings

2. Select ON for `Group unread channels separately` and save (if not already enabled)

3. Have another user make unreads for you in a few channels, including the following:

   - A direct message
   - An @ mention in a private channel
   - A non-mention in a public channel

- (**Invalid**) [Desktop: X displayed next to DM channel in unread section — MM-22316](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22316)

**Expected**

Mentions and unread channels are sorted at top

---

**Step 2**

- Click on a channel that doesn't have any unread posts, then

- Use keyboard shortcuts to move up and down through unread channels:

  - Windows:

    - ALT+SHIFT+UP
    - ALT+SHIFT+DOWN

  - Mac

    - ⌥⇧⇡
      \
      (OPTION+SHIFT+UP)
    - ⌥⇧⇣
      \
      (ALT+SHIFT+DOWN)

_Important notes about this step:_

- **Since you're starting out below the unreads section (in a channel that lacks any unread posts) you'll need to click on the top most unread before exhausting the list in order to test the down arrow navigation.**
- Channels, DMs and GMs will vanish from the Unreads section once read and as you click another unread channel/DM/GM.
- Once there is only a single one left in the Unread section you can clear it out by clicking any other channel/DM/GM or by using the 'x' on a DM or GM.

**Expected**

- `\+UP` should move you upward through unread channels in the Unreads section
- `\+DOWN` should move you downward through unread channels in the Unreads section
- No `x` to close channels (including DMs) is displayed in the Unreads section until after you click it to read it
- Clicking the 'x' will remove the DM from the Unreads section but not from the sidebar completely
- No 'x' appears for public or private channels in the Unreads section whether read or unread
