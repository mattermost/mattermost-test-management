---

**Step 1**

Should not send the browser back in history when pressing the backspace key without an input\
\--------------------\
1\. Visit a couple of different channel URLs (e.g. 4 URLs)\
2\. Visit a DM URL\
3\. Type a message in the post input and hit backspace twice\
4\. Remove focus from post input and hit backspace twice again

**Expected**

After #3,

- Verify that last two characters from message has been removed

After #4,

- Verify that URL is still the DM URL and message is not further truncated
