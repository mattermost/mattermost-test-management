## MM-T4085: CTRL/CMD+K - Unread Channels and input field focus

---

**Step 1**

Note: See [MM-T3002](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T3002) as first step. It's separated since these particular step can't be automated in Cypress.

1. Click outside of the browser window, leaving the Mattermost in the background
2. Click back on the browser window to bring Mattermost back in focus

**Expected**

1\. On step 1,

- The Switch Channels modal is out of focus
- Unread Channels are listed

2\. On step 2,

- Focus is back in the input field of the Switch Channels modal
- Unread Channels are listed
