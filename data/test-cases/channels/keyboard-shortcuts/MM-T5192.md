_CMD+Shift+U should toggle between unreads and all channels_

1. Verify that the unread filter is not enabled

2. Create a couple of new channels, one of which is unread and one of which is not

   1. Verify that the channels are correctly read and unread

3. Press CMD+Shift+U

   1. Verify that the read channel has been hidden
   2. Verify that the unread channel is still visible

4. Press CMD+SHift+U again

   1. Verify that the read channel has reappeared
