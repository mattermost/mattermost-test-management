## MM-T2022: Muted channels

---

**Step 1**

Mute few channels on the sidebar

**Expected**

Muted channels keep their spot within the category, no longer sort to the bottom of their sidebar category (starting in 5.26, phase 2 sidebar)

---

**Step 2**

Ensure logged in user has mentions in some muted channels, not all

**Expected**

Muted channel should appear at reduced opacity in the sidebar, including the mention badge

---

**Step 3**

Collapse the category with the muted channels

**Expected**

Verify muted channels without the mentions have been collapsed\
Verify muted channels with mentions are not collapsed and are shown with other Unread channels
