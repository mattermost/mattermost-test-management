1. Pick up any DM to move

**Expected**

- Mouse cursor becomes dragging cursor - closed hand
- DM being dragged should float beneath the mouse cursor

**Step 3**

1. Drag DM over DM Category

- Channels category remains dimmed and does not expand or give indication DM can be dropped there

---

**Step 6**

1. Drag a DM over any custom Category header (or Favorited) while that category is collapsed

_Important notes about this step:_

When a channel (that is not currently open in the main view) is moved to a category that is collapsed the category shows an indication that channel will drop in the first position even though it will not be visible/shown there immediately - Expected?

**Expected**

- Category header is outlined indicating items can be dropped there
- Shows an indication that channel will drop in the first position

---

- Shows an indication that channel will drop in the first position
- DMs can be dropped between existing channels

---

**Step 8**

1. Drag a DM in any direction

- Can't drop cursor is shown when hovering outside of sidebar or non-droppable areas on the sidebar

---

**Step 9**

1. Drag a DM to near top or bottom of the sidebar to trigger scrolling

**Expected**

- Scrolling while dragging is allowed
- Scrolling should be smooth, not sticky or jumpy

---

**Step 10**

1. Drag a DM and press ESC

**Expected**

- Dragging is canceled
- DM is returned to its original position

---
