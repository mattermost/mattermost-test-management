## MM-T3312: Remove NEW badge from custom category as channels are added

**Objective**

`New` badge to disappear after channel is dropped into new category, even if it is immediately removed from the new category.\
New badge is also removed on refresh. (currently not part of this automated test)

---

**Step 1**

- Create a new category

  - Verify that the new category has been added to the sidebar and that it has the required badge and drop target

- Move Town Square into the new category

  - Verify that Town Square has moved into the new category
  - Verify that the new category badge and drop target have been removed

- Move Town Square out of the new category

  - Verify that Town Square has moved out of the new category
  - Verify that the new category badge and drop target did not reappear

[New badge in the category header reappears after channel is removed from the category —MM-26501](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26501)

**Expected**

- Instead of leaving the category set as "new" until refresh, we now clear new badge as soon as channel is added 
- New badge should not show again when the category is emptied
