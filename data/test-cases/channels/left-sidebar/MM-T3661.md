\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\

1. Open Mattermost
2. On the LHS, shift+click on a channel other than the active channel, but in the same category as the active channel
3. Click and drag the selected channels to another category and drop

**Expected**

- All channels between current active channel and the one clicked on while holding shift are selectedÂ 
- All selected channels should drop in the new category in the order they originally appeared, and should now be unselected.

**Step 2**

Drag and drop multi-selected channels, DMs and GMs to Channels category using cmd/ctrl+click\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\

1. Open Mattermost, ensure new sidebar is enabled
2. On the LHS, use cmd/ctrl+click on few channels not currently in Channels category, few DMs and/or GMs
3. Click and drag the selected channels to Channels category and drop

**Expected**

- Only selected channels are dropped to Channels category
- DMs and GMs are not moved to Channels category and remain selected and can be moved again to appropriate custom category or to DM category

---

**Step 3**

Drag and drop multi-selected channels, DMs and GMs to DM category using cmd/ctrl+click\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\

1. Open Mattermost, ensure new sidebar is enabled
2. On the LHS, cmd/ctrl+click on few channels not currently in Channels category, few DMs and/or GMs
3. Click and drag the selected channels to DM category and drop

**Expected**

- Only selected DMs and GMs are dropped to DM category
- Channels are not moved to DM category, they remain selected and can be moved again to any custom category or to Channels category

---

**Step 4**

Dismiss multi-selected channels, DMs and GMs\\

1. Open Mattermost
2. In the LHS, shift+click a channel other than the active channel.
3. Ctrl+Click another channel or DM/GM that are not part of the selection
4. Click somewhere other than on the one of the selected channels
5. Repeat the steps 1-3 again and select a group on channels again
6. Click on ESC
