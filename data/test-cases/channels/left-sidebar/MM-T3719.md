---

**Step 1**

Unreads category should show only if there is an unread message\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Toggle Unread setting in Settings>Sidebar>Group unread channels separately (Default is 'Unchecked')
2. Receive a message or ensure there are some unread channels by marking few as unread manually
   \
   i. Verify UNREADS category is shown and that the channel is in there
3. Click on the Unread channel
   \
   i. Verify we've switched to the new channel\
   ii. Verify the channel is no longer unread but hasn't left the unreads category
4. Switch to another channel
   \
   i. Verify unreads category has disappeared\
   ii. Verify channel is in the CHANNELS category

**Expected**

- When enabled Unreads category shows on top of the sidebar only if there is an unread message
- Clearing all unreads removes the category from the sidebar

---

**Step 2**

Unreads category should disappear when the setting is turned off\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Verify UNREADS category is shown and that at least one channel is in there
2. Disable the unreads category (Settings>Sidebar>Group unread channels separately)
   \
   i. Verify unreads category has disappeared\
   ii. Verify that the channel is in the CHANNELS category

**Expected**

- Unreads category disappears when the setting is toggled off in Settings > Sidebar

---

**Step 3**

Channels marked as unread should appear in the UNREADS category\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Click on the Unread channel
2. Switch to another channel
   \
   i. Verify that the channel is currently in the CHANNELS category
3. Switch back to the test channel
4. Mark the last message as unread
   \
   i. Verify that the channel appears in the UNREADS section

**Expected**

- Channels marked as unread appear in the UNREADS category

---
