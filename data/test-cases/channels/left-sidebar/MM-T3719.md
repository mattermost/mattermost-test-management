---

**Step 1**

Unreads category should show only if there is an unread message\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Toggle Unread setting in Settings>Sidebar>Group unread channels separately (Default is 'Unchecked')
2. Receive a message or ensure there are some unread channels by marking few as unread manually\
   i. Verify UNREADS category is shown and that the channel is in there
3. Click on the Unread channel\
   i. Verify we've switched to the new channel\
   ii. Verify the channel is no longer unread but hasn't left the unreads category
4. Switch to another channel\
   i. Verify unreads category has disappeared\
   ii. Verify channel is in the CHANNELS category

**Expected**

- When enabled Unreads category shows on top of the sidebar only if there is an unread message
- Clearing all unreads removes the category from the sidebar

---

**Step 2**

Unreads category should disappear when the setting is turned off\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Verify UNREADS category is shown and that at least one channel is in there
2. Disable the unreads category (Settings>Sidebar>Group unread channels separately)\
   i. Verify unreads category has disappeared\
   ii. Verify that the channel is in the CHANNELS category

**Expected**

- Unreads category disappears when the setting is toggled off in Settings > Sidebar

---

**Step 3**

Channels marked as unread should appear in the UNREADS category\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Click on the Unread channel
2. Switch to another channel\
   i. Verify that the channel is currently in the CHANNELS category
3. Switch back to the test channel
4. Mark the last message as unread\
   i. Verify that the channel appears in the UNREADS section

**Expected**

- Channels marked as unread appear in the UNREADS category

---
