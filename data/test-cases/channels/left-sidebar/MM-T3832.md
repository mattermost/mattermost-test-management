## MM-T3832: DMs/GMs should not be removed from the sidebar when only viewed (no message)

---

**Step 1**

DMs/GMs should not be removed from the sidebar when only viewed (no message)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Have enough DMs/GMs open in the sidebar that the oldest ones are cut off by the autoclosing setting

2. Receive a DM from a user that you have never DMed before

3. Click on the new DM to mark it read

4. Switch to Town Square.

   1. Verify we are on Town Square

5. Refresh the page

   1. Verify that the DM we just read remains in the sidebar

**Expected**

The DM/GM remains in the sidebar
