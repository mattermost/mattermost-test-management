## MM-T3834: Sidebar Category sorting

---

**Step 1**

Category sorting\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Create 5 channels and add to custom category

2. Click on the category 3-dot menu dropdown and select Sort >Alphabetically

   1. Verify alphabetical sort order

3. Create and add another channel into the same category

   1. Verify category outlines on drop and channel is placed within the category in the correct alphabetical order set in the previous step, not where you dropped it

4. Switch category sorting to Recency (click on a 3-dot menu dropdown and select Sort >Recent Activity)

   1. Verify that the channels are in reverse order that they were created (when sorted per recent activity)

5. Add another channel to the category

   1. Verify that the channels are still in reverse order that they were created

6. Remove the oldest channel from the category and put it into Favorites (Click on the channel 3-dot menu dropdown and select Move to Favorites)

   1. Verify the channel is now in Favorites

7. Switch category sorting to Manual (click on a 3-dot menu dropdown and select Sort > Manual)

8. Drop another channel into the manually sorted category by scrolling and dropping to the bottom of the category

   1. Verify category does not outline and that the channel has been placed at the bottom of the category

**Expected**

- The channel is placed in its correct position in alphabetical or recency order, and the category sorting method persists after drop
- When manual sorting is selected, channel is placed into the exact position that it was dropped in
