**Step 1**

1. As Â **users**, send a plain message (w/no mentions) in the test channel.
2. Switch to **User B.**

**Test Data**

a channel with 2 users - **users** and **User B**, where **User B** has already dismissed the unread and mention badge from being added to the channel (see MM-T4607)

**Expected**

the channel has an unread highlight
