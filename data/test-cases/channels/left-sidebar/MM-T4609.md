**Step 1**

1. As Â **UserA**, send a plain message (w/no mentions) in the test channel.
2. Switch to **UserB.**

**Test Data**

a channel with 2 users - **UserA** and **UserB**, where **UserB** has already dismissed the unread and mention badge from being added to the channel (see MM-T4607)

**Expected**

the channel has an unread highlight
