## MM-T3864: Sticky categories (currently disabled)

---

**Step 1**

Sticky Categories\
\-------------------

1. Create a custom category and 15 channels, do not collapse
2. Create 10 channels and add to Favorites category
3. Receive a message from another user in the first channel in your sidebar
4. Scroll to the center of the channel list
   1. Verify, when present, "More unreads" banner is not obstructing the category header and they are both visible
5. Scroll to the bottom of the list
   1. Verify that the 'More Unreads' label is still visible, but the Favorites category is no longer visible (other categories will still be visible)

NOTE: Known issue - Sticky Headers are not implemented/working on Safari and Firefox.
