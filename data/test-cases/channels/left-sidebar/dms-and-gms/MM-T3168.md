## MM-T3168: DM Category context menu (sort and limit)

---

**Step 1**

DM Category context menu\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Open 40+ DMs/GMs on the sidebar

   1. Verify only 20 are shown by default, sorted by recency

2. Click on the 3-dot DM category menu

   1. Verify menu opens, with 3 options: Sort, Show and Open a Direct Message

3. Change the number of DMs to show "All Direct Messages"

   1. Verify all open DMs/GMs from step 1. are shown

4. Open few DMs/GMs in the center channel to view only

5. Change the sort order to Alphabetical and choose 15 as the number to show

   1. Verify only 15 DMs/GMs are shown, recently viewed in step 4 should also be included on the short list shown

6. Open few DMs/GMs and send a message in each

7. Change the sort order to Recent Activity and choose 10 number to show

   1. Verify only 10 DMs/GMs are shown, recently active in step 6 should also be included on the short list shown

8. Open a new DM that is not already on the sidebar

   1. Verify that the new open DM is shown on the sidebar and the oldest viewed/active on the sidebar is bumped off the list

9. Ensure Group Unreads separately is set to OFF in account settings and have another user send you a DM, one that is not currently open on the sidebar

   1. Verify the new received DM is shown on the sidebar and the oldest viewed/active on the sidebar is bumped off the list

10. While showing only 10 DMs/GMs on the sidebar with either alpha or recent sort, receive more than 10 DMs/GMs (can be existing or new)

    1. Verify all the DMs/GMs with unreads are show in the sidebar regardless of the user selected number to show

Cypress Note: This can be broken into more steps if necessary. QA will adjust the steps after implementation and match the steps during e2e PR review.

**Expected**

Note: Last viewed time is used as main criteria in determining which DMs are displayed in both Alphabetical and Recent Activity sort order

- User can set various limits around sorting and displaying DMs/GMs on the sidebar
- Received unread DMs/GMs are always shown on the sidebar, regardless of the user configuration
