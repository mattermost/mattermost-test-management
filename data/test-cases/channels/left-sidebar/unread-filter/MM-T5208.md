## MM-T5208: Channel Sidebar Unread Filter > Continue to show global Threads item when unread filter is enabled

---

**Step 1**

\_\_When unread filter is enabled, g\_lobal Threads item should continue to display pinned on the sidebar even without any unread threads \_\\

1. Login as normal user and ensure "group unreads separately" setting is disabled

   1. Verify there is no Unread category on the sidebar 
   2. Verify that unread filter is in all channels state

2. Enable Collapsed Reply Threads for the user and ensure there are no unread threads

   1. Verify Threads global item is present on the sidebar, no unread threads

3. Create a couple of new channels, one of which is unread and one of which is not

   1. Verify that the channels are correctly read and unread

4. Enable Unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is in filter by unread state
   2. Verify that the read channel has been hidden
   3. Verify that the unread channel is still visible
   4. Verify that Threads item is still visible on the sidebar despite not having any unread threads

5. Disable the unread filter

   1. Verify that the unread filter is back in all channels state, and the read channel has reappeared

**Expected**

- When the unread filter is enabled, we should show “Threads” pinned at the top of the sidebar even if there’s no unread threads.
