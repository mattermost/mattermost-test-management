(**Story**) [Prevent marking a channel as read when user manually marked as unread — MM-17754](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17754)

**Test Data**

**Note to Step 4**: A use case for marking it as unread might be that the user doesn't have time to read the post right then but doesn't want to lose track of it.

**Expected**

On Step 1:\\

- Channel becomes unread on the LHS and shows correct mention bubble with the count
- Once **UserB** clicks on that channel the count vanishes
- New Messages line appears above the post

On Step 2:\\

- The New message line is gone

On Step 3:\\

- The New message line is gone

On Step 4:\\

- New Messages line remains above the marked post, Channel becomes unread on the LHS and shows correct mention bubble with the count

On Step 5:\\

- Message is **still** marked unread upon returning
- Channel count is missing

On Step 6:\\

- Message is **still** marked unread after refresh
- Channel count is missing
