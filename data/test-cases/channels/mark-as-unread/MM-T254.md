**Step 1**

2. Verify the mention badge count - counts the post marked as unread and all the posts created afterwards

(**Story**) [Server: Rehydrate mention badge when marking a channel as unread — MM-17071](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17071)

**Expected**

- When marking a channel as unread, the mention badge should count all mentions below and including the selected post, including at-mentions, custom keywords, and reply mentions.
- In particular, at-here should mention the user even if they were offline when the post was originally made.
