(**Story**) [RN: Update app badge when marking a post as unread from another device — MM-18463](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18463)

**Expected**

- **iOS**:

  - The app badge should be updated to match the number of unread mentions on the left side of the channel header whenever a channel is marked as unread, even if it happens from another device and/or when the app is closed.

- **Android:**

  - The app badge will not be updated, but the user should not receive any erroneous notifications when marking a channel as unread from another device.
