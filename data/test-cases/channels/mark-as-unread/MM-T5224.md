## MM-T5224: The latest post should appear unread after marking the channel as unread with alt/option+left-click on channel sidebar item

---

**Step 1**

1. Channel A starts as unread

2. Visit Channel A

   - Verify channel A becomes read after you viewed it

3. Switch to channel B

   - Verify Channel A remains read

4. Mark channel A as unread using alt/option+left-click on the sidebar channel name item

   - Verify channel A shows as unread on the sidebar

5. Switch back to channel A

   - Verify the New Messages line above the last post (post3)

**Expected**

When marking the channels as unread using alt/option+left-click, the channel should show as unread on the sidebar and the New Messages line should appear above the last post in the channel.
