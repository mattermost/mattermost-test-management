## MM-T108: RN apps: Long message expands message box; no delay in posting it

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: Long message expands message box; no delay in posting it\
\--------------------\
1\. In any channel, type a multi-line message (can copy a phrase and paste it repeatedly; don't post it yet)\
2\. At the end of the message, type a bunch of characters as quickly as you can, then immediately tap on the "aeroplane" icon

**Expected**

The text box should expand to multiple lines as the message is typed. There should be no lag between pushing the send button and the message posting.
