## MM-T113: Delete a Message during reply, other user sees '(message deleted)'

---

**Step 1**

Delete a Message during reply, other user sees `(message deleted)`\
\--------------------\
1\. Have another user post a message in a channel you can see\
2\. Click the reply arrow to \*start\* to reply to the message (but do not post the reply; just view the reply thread and start to type a reply in the reply box)\
3\. Have the other user delete the message they posted, \[...] > Delete\
4\. After the other user has deleted the parent message, press Enter to send your reply\
5\. Observe the modal that appears, then click `Okay` to close it (leave RHS open)\
6\. Enter another reply and press Enter or tap to send

**Expected**

Your view:\
The deleted parent post shows as (message deleted).\
When try to post the reply anyway, a modal (FYI specifically the PostDeletedModal) is shown that tells you "Someone deleted the message on which you tried to post a comment." The RHS / reply thread should remain open, and the reply draft remains in text box.\
\
The other user, who deleted the message, should not see "(message deleted)" in any way because of your unsent reply\
\
When you close the warning modal and try to send a second reply, the modal appears again.
