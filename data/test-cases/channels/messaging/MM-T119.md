## MM-T119: RN apps: Messages are marked as read on RN app when read on webapp

---

**Step 1**

Mobile apps: Messages are marked as read on RN app when read on webapp\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in as same user on both RN app and webapp\
2\. On both, view the same channel\
3\. Have another user post a message in a \*different\* channel from the one you are viewing\
4\. Observe both RN app and webapp show that channel as unread\
5\. On webapp, switch to that channel to read the message

**Expected**

On RN app, observe in channel drawer that the channel no longer appears unread
