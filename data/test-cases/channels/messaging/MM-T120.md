## MM-T120: RN apps: Messages are marked as read on webapp when read on RN app

---

**Step 1**

Mobile apps: Messages are marked as read on webapp when read on RN app\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in as same user on both RN app and webapp\
2\. On both, view the same channel\
3\. Have another user post a message in a \*different\* channel from the one you are viewing\
4\. Observe both RN app and webapp show that channel as unread\
5\. On RN app, switch to that channel to read the message

**Expected**

On webapp, observe in LHS that the channel no longer appears unread (has been marked read)
