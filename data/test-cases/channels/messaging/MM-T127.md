\--------------------\
\
\*\* Test this on community-release.mattermost.com so you can see some older data \*\*\
\
\*\* DESKTOP APP: Narrow to mobile view for this test, then back to standard view to continue testing \*\*\
\

2\. View a channel that has at least several days of messages\
3\. Scroll up in the channel, observe the floating timestamp / date indicator

**Test Data**
