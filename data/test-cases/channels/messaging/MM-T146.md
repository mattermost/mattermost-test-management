## MM-T146: Click or tap another user's emoji reaction to add it as well

---

**Step 1**

1. Have another user add an emoji reaction to a post
2. Click or tap their reaction to add the same reaction from your user, observe the reaction background is another color to show you added it as well
   \
   **WEBAPP only**: shows odometer style emoji animation when incrementing existing emoji reaction
3. Click or tap the + icon to open the reaction emoji picker and select another reaction to add
4. Click or tap each of the reactions you added

Bug: [Emoji reaction shifting down a few pixels after clicking — MM-21344](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21344)

**Expected**

- Each of your reactions is removed when you click/tap it
- Other user's reaction remains
- Count is vertically centered
- Emoji stays in place and does not shift down a few pixels
- Odometer style animation plays on the browser when incrementing existing emoji
