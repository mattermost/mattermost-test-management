**Expected**

After 4) you should see the "Reactions" screen showing a list of people (which will all be you!) who reacted with the specific emoji\
\
The screen should slide up with an animation and can be expanded by dragging up or closed by dragging down\
\
Screen defaults to viewing "All 12". Ensure no emoji are missing and that rows display properly.\
\
You can tap on each emoji across the top of the screen which will show you the username of the person who reacted with that emoji\
\
Scroll or slide down to close the reactions screen
