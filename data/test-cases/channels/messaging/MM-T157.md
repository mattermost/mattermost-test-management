## MM-T157: Filtered emojis are sorted by recency, then begins with, then contains (alphabetically within each)

---

**Step 1**

Filtered emojis are sorted by recency, then begins with, then contains (alphabetically within each)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post the following emoji in a message:
   \
   \
   :guardsman:
2. In a separate message post the following emoji:
   \
   \
   :white\_small\_square:
3. Click the emoji icon on the message box to open the emoji picker
4. Observe :white\_small\_square: is listed first, and :guardsman: is listed second, in Recently Used section
5. Type "sma" in the emoji search filter box

**Expected**

- In filtered list, recently used emoji are first, in alphabetical order:
  \
  \
  :guardsman: :white\_small\_square:
- Followed by emoji that start with "sma" in alphabetical:
  \
  \
  :small\_airplane: :small\_blue\_diamond: :small\_orange\_diamond: :small\_red\_triangle: :small\_red\_triangle\_down:
- Followed by emoji that contain "sma" in alphabetical:
  \
  \
  :arrow\_down\_small: :arrow\_up\_small: :black\_medium\_small\_square: :black\_small\_square: :sun\_behind\_small\_cloud: :white\_medium\_small\_square:

**Note**: If you have recently used an emoji that matches the search term, you'll see it in the results as well, so it might not match exactly what is listed above
