_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: Older MacOS (such as Sierra) may fail to show the i-love-you gesture, just rendering it as the box. It should still at least show as jumbo. Story filed to regenerate the newer Unicode emoticon set from the latest MacOS: MM-14404

**Test Data**

:D :thumbsup: 🤟

**Expected**

- All three emoji show as jumbo: smile, thumbs up, i-love-you gesture\
  **Note**: The "[I Love You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILY_sign)" gesture has its origins in American Sign Language (ASL).
