## MM-T1663: RHS reply thread that has been scrolled up should not automatically scroll down after receiving a new message

---

**Step 1**

RHS reply thread doesn't scroll down after receiving a new message\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post a message in a channel
2. Post enough replies to that message so that the right-hand side is scrollable
3. On the right-hand side reply thread, scroll to the top of the thread
4. Use another account to post a new reply in the thread
