## MM-T170: RN apps: @-mentions and user search are not case sensitive

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: @-mentions and user search are not case sensitive\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In a test channel, at-mention a test user in both upper and lower-case (e.g. @testuser @TestUser)
2. Click on the "search" icon and search for "from:TESTuser"

**Expected**

- Both 1) and 2) should work as at-mentions and user search are not case sensitive
