## MM-T173: Edit post with 'strikethrough' and ensure channel auto-complete closes after second tilde (~~)

---

**Step 1**

Edit post with "strikethrough" and ensure channel auto-complete closes after second tilde (\~\~)\
\--------------------\
1\. Type a post into the input box and hit "enter" key\
2\. Hit the "up" arrow to open the edit modal\
3\. Position cursor at the beginning of the post and type two tildes (\~\~), observe channel autocomplete open then close\
4\. Position cursor at the end of the post and type two tildes (\~\~)\
5\. Hit "enter" key

**Expected**

After 3) typing the first tilde should open the channel autocomplete, and typing the second tilde should close the autocomplete\
Note: typing the tildes at the end of the post being edited does NOT open/close the channel autocomplete\
\
After 5) edited post is shown in the channel, with "strikethrough" formatting
