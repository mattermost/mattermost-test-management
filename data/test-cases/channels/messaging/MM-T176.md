## MM-T176: Permalink - timestamp link opens permalink view, both center and RHS (mobile view, but not mobile apps)

---

**Step 1**

Permalink - timestamp link opens permalink view, both center and RHS (mobile view, but not mobile apps)\
\--------------------\
1\. Click on the timestamp of a message in the RHS, and\
2\. Click on the timestamp of a message in the center channel

**Expected**

In both cases, permalink should open in same window, not a new window, both on browser and desktop app (N/A for mobile apps; not a link)
