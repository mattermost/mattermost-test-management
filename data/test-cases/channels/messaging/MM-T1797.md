## MM-T1797: Compact view: Show single image thumbnail

---

**Step 1**

1. Make a post with some text and a single image

_Related ticket(s):_

[Show single image thumbnails in compact view â€” MM-16425](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16425)

_Important notes about this step:_

There has been no change to the current behavior of other uploads or multiple image uploads. This ticket is for single image thumbnails only.

**Expected**

- The name of the image appears on a new line and is not bolded
- There are arrows to collapse the preview
