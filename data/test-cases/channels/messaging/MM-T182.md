## MM-T182: Typing using CJK keyboard

---

**Step 1**

Typing using CJK keyboard\
\--------------------\
NOTE: If you need help, please ask QA and we'll help. :) (Googling for your particular environment can be really helpful as well)\
\
1\. Switch your keyboard to a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean keyboard (settings vary by OS)\
\- In general: Should be able to add in System / Keyboard settings, then view Mattermost, then click or tap keyboard settings icon to toggle it\
\
2\. Type characters in message box and post; you will likely see some characters combining as you type, and that is the expected behavior\
3\. Open reply to that message, type a reply, post the reply\
\
If you want to repro a specific Korean example:\
\- Set keyboard to use 2-Set Korean\
\- Type the following sequence of letters (do not copy/paste):\
\
dkssuggktpdy\
\
\- Verify some characters combined as you typed\
\- Press Enter to post

_Important notes about this step:_

(Issues had been coming up frequently; good to be able to test each time on Chrome and RN apps)\
\
Can't test on desktop app due to no East Asian IME available

**Expected**

Both message and reply post as expected, with some characters combining as you type\
\
\- Post should appear as:\
안녕하세요\
\
Incorrect behavior: Input and/or post looks like this, with each keystroke appearing as an individual character:\
ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹㅇㅣㅂㄹㅕㄱㅁㅜㄴㅈㅔ
