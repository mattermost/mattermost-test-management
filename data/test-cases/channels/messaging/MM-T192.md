## MM-T192: RN apps: Wide markdown table will truncate and display properly when tapped on

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: Wide markdown table will truncate and display properly when tapped on\
\--------------------\
1\. From a browser/desktop app, copy, paste, and post the text from the attached note in a channel (will render as a large table)\
\
2\. View the post from the RN app

**Test Data**

(Note: Open ticket to improve discoverability of being able to tap on the markdown table to open full screen view https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14199 - fixed)

**Expected**

In RN apps: Table is truncated on right and bottom edges, and has slight gradient shading down the right-hand-side as well as along the bottom edge to indicate there is more content off-screen - similar to long posts (show more/less)\
There is an expand button added to improve discoverability of opening in full screen.(MM-14199)\
\
Tapping on the table will open full table view and in that view:\
\
On Android, you can scroll vertically and horizontally as needed to view the entire table (Android does not support diagonal scrolling so you can only scroll horizontally and then vertically.)\
\
On iOS, you can scroll diagonally / in any direction to view the entire table
