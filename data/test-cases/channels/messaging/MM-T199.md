## MM-T199: Link preview - Removing it from my view removes it from other user's view

---

**Step 1**

Link preview - Removing it from my view removes it from other user's view\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in on a browser with one user (USER 1)
2. Post a link that has a collapsible preview, such as:\
   <https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-45142614>\
   (see Test Data for notes on which links are collapsible)
3. Log in as another user (USER 2) on RN app if testing RN, or another browser or desktop if testing browser or desktop
4. View the channel that USER 1 posted in
5. Have USER 1 click the collapse arrows to collapse the preview
6. Have USER 1 click the arrows to re-expand the link preview
7. Then USER 1 clicks the `x` on the link preview to remove the preview

**Test Data**

**Notes**:

- OpenGraph expand/collapse arrows are only for the image, and only for big ones that appear below the text
- If you need to find a new link to test, news articles often have large images
- YouTube videos also have expand/collapse arrows

**Expanded**\

**Expected**

After #4,\\

- User2 sees the link preview (make sure enabled in Account Settings and System Console if needed)
- Collapse / expand only affects current user's view

After #5,\\

- Preview did \*not\* collapse for USER 2

After #7,\\

- USER 2 no longer sees the preview
- Just sees the URL
- Clicking the `x`, preview is removed for all users
