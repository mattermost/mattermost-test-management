## MM-T211: Leave a long draft in the main input box and view on return

---

**Step 1**

Leave a long draft in the main input box\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Type a post that is several lines long but do not post it (can be done with whitespace)
2. As the post becomes longer note the input box becomes taller to accommodate the text
3. Note also you can delete characters and the input box becomes smaller again, accordingly
4. Switch to a different channel and then return

[\[webapp\] returning to a long draft doesn't maintain scroll position — MM-30230](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-30230)

**Expected**

- On returning to the channel, the input box height has not changed; it is still expanded to accommodate the long draft
