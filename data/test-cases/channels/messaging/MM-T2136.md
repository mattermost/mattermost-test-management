1\. Click "reply" from \[...] menu to reply to a message\
2\. In LHS, click a different channel to open it in center channel\
3\. In RHS, type a comment and Send\
4\. Click off app (this step not tested in Se; can add back to manual if it's an issue)

**Expected**

After both steps 3 and 4, channel you replied in should not be marked unread as a result of your reply (different channel still visible in center channel)
