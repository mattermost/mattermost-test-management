## MM-T2138: Emoji and markdown in 'commented on...' line

---

**Step 1**

Emoji and markdown in "commented on..." line\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Post the following in any channel:\
\
\## \*I'm\* \[hungry]\(http\://example.com) :taco: !\[Mattermost]\(http\://www\.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png)\
\
2\. Post another message in that channel is NOT a reply\
3\. Reply to post made in step 1\
4\. Close the RHS if necessary to view the entire "commented on..." line

**Expected**

The line above the reply shows the text, does not render the emoji or markdown, like so:\
\
"Commented on 's message: I'm hungry :taco: Mattermost"\
\
RN apps: Message contents are not displayed in the "commented on message:" as there is not enough horizontal space on smaller screens.
