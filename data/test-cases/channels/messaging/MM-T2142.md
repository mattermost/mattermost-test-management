## MM-T2142: Edit code block

---

**Step 1**

Edit code block\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Post a comment with four spaces to make a code block:\
" test"\
2\. Click the \[...] menu > Edit in the RHS\
3\. Edit the message to be:\
" test edit"\
4\. Save

**Expected**

The message should be edited in both the RHS and center panel. The message should still be a code block (the spaces were not removed when the edit was saved). "(edited)" should display at the end of the message.
