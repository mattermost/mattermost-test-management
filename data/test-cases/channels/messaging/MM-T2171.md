---

**Step 1**

Un-pinning and pinning a post in center also removes and adds badge in \*Saved posts\* RHS (Se portion)\
————————————————————————————\

2\. Click Saved posts icon\
3\. In center channel, click \[...] > Un-pin from channel\
4\. In center channel, click \[...] > Pin to channel

**Expected**

After step 2: Post appears in Saved posts list, and displays Pinned badge\
After step 3: Post still appears in Saved posts list, and Pinned badge is removed in both center and RHS\
After step 4: Pinned badge returns on message in both center and RHS
