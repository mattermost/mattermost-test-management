## MM-T2198: Ephemeral message doesn't persist in RHS

---

**Step 1**

Ephemeral message doesn't persist in RHS\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Open a RHS reply thread\
2\. Post `/online` in the reply thread to create an ephemeral message\
3\. Close the RHS (mobile: return to channel view), verify reply count did not appear / increase due to the ephemeral message\
4\. Reopen that same reply thread in RHS

**Expected**

Ephemeral message `You are now online` still appears in center, but no longer displays in RHS
