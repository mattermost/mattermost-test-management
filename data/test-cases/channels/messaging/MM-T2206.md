## MM-T2206: At-mention: Not in channel (center), have permission to add (public channel)

---

**Step 1**

@ autocomplete - not in channel (center), have permission to add (public channel)\
————————————————————————————\
As a user who has permission to add members to a channel:\
1\. Identify a user on the team who is not in the public channel you're viewing\
2\. In center, post `@\[thatusername]`\
3\. Ephemeral message displays "{user} was mentioned but is not in the channel. Would you like to add them to the channel? They will have access to all message history."\
4\. Click the link "add them to the channel"

**Expected**

Ephemeral message asking if you want to add the user disappears\
\
System message posts saying that the user was added to the channel
