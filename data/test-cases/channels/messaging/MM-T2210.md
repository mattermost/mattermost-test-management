---

**Step 1**

@ autocomplete - doesn't appear after typing `text@`\
————————————————————————————\
Start typing an email address in a post, such as `example@`

**Expected**

The mention autocomplete does not display (it only shows when the at sign could be part of a mention (ie when it follows whitespace or punctuation))
