## MM-T2211: @ autocomplete - disappears when punctuation immediately follows the at-mention (but it's still a mention, mention doesn't include the punctuation)

---

**Step 1**

@ autocomplete - disappears when punctuation immediately follows the at-mention (but it's still a mention, mention doesn't include the punctuation)\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Type "@user" where user is someone on the server\
2\. Do not select the autocomplete option that displays\
3\. Continue typing punctuation like &%#\* immediately after "@user"\
\
4\. Repeat for followed by three dots

**Expected**

Autocomplete disappears, and message posts with @-mention displayed as link, followed immediately by punctuation (e.g. @user#^@^)
