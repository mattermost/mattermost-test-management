## MM-T2223: Channel shortlinking - ~ not autocomplete

---

**Step 1**

Channel shortlinking - \~ not autocomplete\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Type "\~" followed by a PUBLIC channel name. Do not select an auto-complete result; type the channel name out manually\
2\. Type a space, then some additional text\
3\. Press Enter

**Expected**

If the channel name has a space in it, the message should not contain a channel link (e.g. just "\~town square is fun", nothing linked). If no space, it should link. Autocomplete should stop trying to offer options as soon as the string matches no channels.
