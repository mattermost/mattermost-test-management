## MM-T2226: Channel shortlinking - multiple spaces stops autocomplete

---

**Step 1**

Channel shortlinking - multiple spaces stops autocomplete\
————————————————————————————\
1\. In message box type a tilde and the first couple letters of a channel name\
2\. Observe the autocomplete appears as expected\
3\. Press space bar twice

**Expected**

Channel autocomplete list stays open\
\
Continuing to type characters that don't match a channel closes autocomplete\
Continuing to type characters that do match a channel (including one space) continues to show the autocomplete\
\
(One space is treated the same as multiple spaces)
