## MM-T2239: Delete a Message in permalink view

---

**Step 1**

Delete a Message in permalink view\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Search for a message, copy its permalink from the search results (RN apps long press and select Copy Permalink Link)\
2\. Post the copied link in a channel that another user will be able to see\
3\. Click the link to view in permalink view (User A)\
4\. Also log in as other user B in another browser, find the post, and click the posted link to view in permalink view\
5\. With both users viewing the same message in permalink view:\
6\. User A click \[...] > Delete on the highlighted post

**Expected**

For User B, post text is replaced by "(message deleted)", still highlighted, still in permalink view with a link at bottom to jump to recent messages\
On "(message deleted)" post, the timestamp is not a clickable link\
\
For User A only, post disappears and "(message deleted)" does not display\
User A sees normal channel view, at the bottom of the channel, no longer in permalink view
