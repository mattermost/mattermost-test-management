## MM-T2240: Permalink - opens, can reply from archive view

---

**Step 1**

Permalink - opens, can reply from archive view\
————————————————————————————\
1\. In a public channel, click the \[...] menu to the right of any message\
2\. Select "Permalink"\
3\. Click the "Copy Link" button in the dialog if it is available, otherwise copy the link manually\
5\. Switch to a different channel and post the URL you just copied\
6\. Click the link you just posted\
7\. Observe that you are taken to the message of the permalink you copied in step 3\
8\. Verify permalink is highlighted\
9\. Click the \[...] menu to the right of the highlighted message and select "reply"

**Expected**

RHS should open with cursor focused in the "Add a comment" box\
\
This is already in Se, except for verifying focus in RHS (there are other focus tests)
