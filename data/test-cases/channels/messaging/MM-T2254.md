## MM-T2254: Retry Send (including multiple clicks)

---

**Step 1**

Retry Send (including multiple clicks)\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Turn off Internet connection (on mobile device, use airplane mode)\
2\. Type a post and press Enter\
3\. Click Retry a few times\
4\. Hover over timestamp and verify it's not a link\
5\. Turn Internet connection back on\
6\. Click Retry several times in quick succession as internet is reconnecting

**Expected**

No action when Retry is clicked with Internet connection still off\
\
Message ultimately only posts once
