## MM-T2347: RN apps: Access recent reactions from the long press menu

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: Access recent reactions from the long press menu\
\--------------------\
1\. Long press a post to open the menu\
2\. Select a reaction from recent reactions\
3\. Long press the post to open the menu again

_Related ticket(s):_

<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22362>

**Expected**

After #1,

- **Add Reaction** option is removed from the available options in the long press menu

- 6 reactions are shown, in the order of recently used, then a button to open the normal emoji picker.

- If there are no recently used emoji, these should be shown:

  - Slot 1: thumbsup
  - Slot 2: smiley
  - Slot 3: white\_check\_mark
  - Slot 4: heart
  - Slot 5: eyes
  - Slot 6: raised\_hands
  - Slot 7: Button to open emoji picker

- If the user is not able to react, then this emoji row is HIDDEN (same as existing permissions with read only channels)

After #2,

- Reaction is added to the post

After #3,

- Once recently used emoji exist, it is slotted in at Slot 1 > 6, pushing the default emoji out.
