---

**Step 1**

RN apps: @ autocomplete - nickname\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Add nickname at 3-dot menu ➜ Tap Profile Photo ➜ Tap Edit ➜ Nickname and Save
2. In a channel, start to @ mention the user using nickname
3. Modify full name, username and/or nickname so that if won't fit in the autocomplete horizontally
4. In a channel, start to @ mention the user using nickname as before

**Expected**

After #2,

- User with nickname is available in autocomplete popup
- User's nickname, if set, is displayed in parenthesis next to the user's display name. Matches functionality of the web app.

**Note:** If current user, if nickname is set, nickname should not be displayed, **(you)** should be displayed instead, e.g. Joseph Baylon (you) @joseph.baylon\
\
After #4,

- If the full name, username and/or nickname cannot fit in the autocomplete horizontally, it is truncated with ellipsis (...)
- This verification will not be part of detox automation
