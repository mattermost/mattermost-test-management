## MM-T3293: Entire thread appears and scrollable in the RHS

---

**Step 1**

1. Create a thread with several replies to make it scrollable in RHS
2. Create enough posts from another user (not related to the thread on the same channel) to not load on a first load (at least 35)
3. Reply on original thread
4. Reload browser
5. Hit on reply to open thread on RHS
