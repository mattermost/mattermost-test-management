---

**Step 1**

System admins prompted before joining private channel via permalink\
\------------------------\
1\. Should leave the team (if joined while trying to access private channel) if user decides not to join the private channel.\
2\. Should show prompts when opened directly from address bar.\
3\. Should show prompts without leaving the screen upon pressing on channel url/permalink.
