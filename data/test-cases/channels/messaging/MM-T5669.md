## MM-T5669: Navigating DM list using Up/Down arrow keys scrolls it

---

**Step 1**

1. Click the "+" next to the "Direct Messages" category header in the LHS to open the DM list modal.
2. Ensure there are enough list items such that you'll need to scroll to see the rest.
3. Press the down arrow key to navigate through items to an item out of view.
4. Press the up arrow key to navigate back up to an item out of view.

**Expected**

The DM list scrolls to reveal the hidden items in step 3 and 4.
