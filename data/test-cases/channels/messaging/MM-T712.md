  Design notes (from MM-31675)\
  _After some investigation, we decided to support the ctrl + enter shortcut, but don't feel we need to advertise it's a supported mechanism to post messages. Supporting the ctrl + enter aligns with our forgiving principle. 0/5 if we should consider this a bug or not._

**Test Data**

Note:

- Windows/Linux: CTRL+ENTER
- Mac: ⌘+ENTER

**Expected**
