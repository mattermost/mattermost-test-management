## MM-T75: RN apps: iOS ONLY - If the keyboard is open, swiping down past it should close it

---

**Step 1**

RN iOS only: If the keyboard is open, swiping down past it should close it\
\--------------------\
1\. Tap on the message input box to open the keyboard\
2\. Swipe down to scroll the channel, extending over top of the text input box

**Expected**

Keyboard should close if the swipe action goes overtop the text input box.\
\
The keyboard should NOT close if the swipe action is only on the channel, and not over the keyboard.
