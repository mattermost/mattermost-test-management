**Step 1**

Open edit modal immediately after making a post\
\--------------------\
1\. Post a message in a channel\
2\. Type a second post, with different text from the first one, into the input box\
3\. Hit 'enter' key and then immediately (as FAST as you can) hit 'arrow-up' to open the edit box\
4\. If pressed while the new post was still pending, observe the edit box opens for the first post\
5\. Press ESC to close edit modal\
6\. Press UP again

**Expected**

\
Step 6: Edit modal opens for the second post
