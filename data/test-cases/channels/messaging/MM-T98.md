## MM-T98: Typing should show up right away when editing a message using the up arrow

---

**Step 1**

Typing should show up right away when editing a message using the up arrow\
\--------------------\
1\. Post a message\
2\. Hit the up arrow to open the "edit modal"\
3\. Begin typing straight away as quickly as you can

**Expected**

There is no delay in letters appearing in the edit modal, no text is lost, and no text appears in the center panel in the background
