## MM-T288: RN apps: iOS ONLY - Update profile image from file

---

**Step 1**

RN - Update profile image from file\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Select the camera icon on the profile picture again
2. Observe the options that appear (should not see video options)
3. Select Browse File
4. On your device locate a non-image file such as a PDF and try to select it (should not be able to)
5. Select an image file

_Important notes about this step:_

RF is Android-only right now while figuring out file issues on iOS emulator

**Expected**

- Profile image successfully updated from a file on your device (Only images of file types JPEG, PNG, and BMP should be allowed)
