**Step 1**

RN - Remove profile picture\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Tap three-dot menu in top right, then tap username/profile pic at top
2. On profile edit page, tap profile pic
3. (If that user does not have a profile picture yet, select one and save, then go back to step 2. We want to see this page when the user already has a profile pic)
4. Tap Remove Photo
5. Observe profile pic disappears and placeholder image appears
6. Tap Save

**Expected**

- Default profile pic (circle with color and initial) appears as your profile picture
