## MM-T3401: Join Team list scroll and scale

---

**Step 1**

Join Team list scale\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Ensure there are multiple teams available on the server
2. Open Main menu > Join another team
3. Change window width and height, e.g down to mobile web view and then back up to full screen,
4. Scroll through the list

**Expected**

- The list container should scale in width based on the users viewport and device (up to 800px max)
- List container height scales with the height of the browser window.
- Infinite scrolling is available to load more teams.
