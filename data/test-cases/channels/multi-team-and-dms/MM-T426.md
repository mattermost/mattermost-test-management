## MM-T426: System messages wrap properly

---

**Step 1**

System messages wrap properly\
\--------------------\
1\. Change any channel header to something relatively long\
2\. Observe the resulting system message that wraps to a 2nd line of text

**Expected**

System messages should display correctly and wrap to a second line of text when needed
