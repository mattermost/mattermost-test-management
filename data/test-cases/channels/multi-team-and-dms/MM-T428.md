## MM-T428: Status changes made from RN are displayed in other clients

---

**Step 1**

Status changes made from RN are displayed in other clients\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right of your screen
2. Tap your status, change to away or offline
3. Have another user observe your user in the LHS DM list (or other places status displays; can take 30-60 seconds to update)

**Expected**

- Other user sees your status as what you updated to (might not update immediately; can open a DM and that might help)

---

**Step 2**

1. Receive a message while in DND mode
2. Reply while in DND mode
