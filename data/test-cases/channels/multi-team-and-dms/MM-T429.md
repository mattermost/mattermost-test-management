## MM-T429: Status changes made in other clients are reflected in RN

---

**Step 1**

Status changes made in other clients are reflected in RN\
\--------------------\
1\. Have user1 in webapp / desktop app set their status to away (can use drop-down or /away)\
2\. Have user1 in webapp / desktop app post a message in any channel\
2\. Log in to that same server on RN app as a different user and open a DM with user1\
3\. Switch channels to locate the post from user1 from step 2\
3\. Observe that status of user1 is away (may take a minute or so to update)\
4\. Have user1 set their status in web browser to DND - Do Not Disturb (can use status drop-down in top left)\
5\. In the RN app, keep the app open without interacting with it, and wait a few minutes, watching for user1's status to update to DND

**Test Data**

FIXED v1.22\
\- <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17588>\
\- <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17612>

**Expected**

The RN app user's view should update to reflect status changes made by the webapp user (can take a minute or couple minutes but should update on its own eventually)
