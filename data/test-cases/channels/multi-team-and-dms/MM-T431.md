## MM-T431: Reopening browser brings you to previously viewed team/channel

---

**Step 1**

Reopening browser brings you to previously viewed team/channel\
\--------------------\
1\. Switch teams a couple times, ending up viewing a team that is NOT listed first in the team sidebar list\
2\. On that team, view a channel that is NOT Town Square or a GM/DM\
3\. Close your browser/tab\
4\. Reopen your browser/tab and open the root URL of that Mattermost server (e.g. https\:/.mattermost.com)

**Expected**

You are brought back to view the channel/team you had been viewing before
