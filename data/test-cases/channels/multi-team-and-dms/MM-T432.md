**Step 1**

Logging out and logging back in brings you to previously viewed team/channel\
\--------------------\
1\. Login as User A and browse to any type of channel on any team\
2\. Logout\
3\. Login again as User A, observe you are directed to the last team and channel you had been viewing\
5\. Logout\
6\. Login as User B, observe you are directed to the last team and channel User B had been viewing\
7\. Logout\
8\. Login as User A

**Expected**

After 8) you are again directed to the last team and channel you were viewing (same as in step 1)
