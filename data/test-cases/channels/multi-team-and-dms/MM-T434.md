## MM-T434: Drawer can be closed from team view by tapping out of it (in addition to swiping back out through channel drawer)

---

**Step 1**

Drawer can be closed from team view by tapping out of it (in addition to swiping back out through channel drawer)\
\--------------------\
1\. Login as a user who belongs to multiple teams\
2\. Open the channel drawer and swipe over to get the team list\
3\. Swipe the drawer back to channel drawer, then swipe the drawer closed\
4\. Re-open the drawer, observe channel list in drawer (not teams)\
5\. Swipe the drawer over to Team list\
6\. Close the drawer entirely by tapping outside the drawer on the right edge of the screen\
7\. Re-open the drawer

**Test Data**

Fixed (Android 9): <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15543>

**Expected**

Channel list is displayed in the drawer (not teams)\
\
If testing on iPad, the channel drawer remains open (this is intended and expected)
