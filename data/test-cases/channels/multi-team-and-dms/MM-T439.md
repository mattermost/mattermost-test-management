## MM-T439: Town Square is not marked as unread for existing users when a new user is added to the team

---

**Step 1**

Town Square is not marked as unread for existing users when a new user is added to the team\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As the test user - User A - disable Join/Leave messages in Account Settings ➜ Advanced ➜ Enable Join/Leave Messages
2. As User A, join a team that User B is not on
3. As User A, view a channel other than Town Square and ensure Town Square is not currently open and is not marked as unread
4. Have a system admin add User B to the team above
5. Once User B is on the team, as User A, verify Town Square is not marked unread
6. As User A, then switch channels to any channel other than Town Square

**Expected**

- User A continues to observe Town Square in the LHS channel list as read and it does not become marked as unread
