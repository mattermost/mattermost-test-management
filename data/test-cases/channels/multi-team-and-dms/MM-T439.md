## MM-T439: Town Square is not marked as unread for existing users when a new user is added to the team

---

**Step 1**

Town Square is not marked as unread for existing users when a new user is added to the team\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As the test user - UserA - disable Join/Leave messages in Account Settings ➜ Advanced ➜ Enable Join/Leave Messages
2. As UserA, join a team that UserB is not on
3. As UserA, view a channel other than Town Square and ensure Town Square is not currently open and is not marked as unread
4. Have a system admin add UserB to the team above
5. Once userB is on the team, as UserA, verify Town Square is not marked unread
6. As UserA, then switch channels to any channel other than Town Square

**Expected**

- UserA continues to observe Town Square in the LHS channel list as read and it does not become marked as unread
