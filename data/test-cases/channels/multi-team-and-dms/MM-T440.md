## MM-T440: Team sidebar overlay

---

**Step 1**

Team sidebar overlay\
\--------------------\
1\. With team sidebar visible\
2\. Post a message\
3\. Click the reply arrow to open RHS\
4\. Click the expand arrows to expand the RHS

**Expected**

Verify that the overlay covers both channel LHS and team sidebar\
\
Verify that clicking the darker overlay portion re-collapses the RHS (but RHS stays open, just not expanded anymore)
