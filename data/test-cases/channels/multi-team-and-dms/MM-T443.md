## MM-T443: RN apps: iOS ONLY - Last DM/GM in the list does not overlap with 2 dots

---

**Step 1**

RN apps (iOS ONLY) - last DM/GM in the list does not overlap with 2 dots\
(There are no floating dots in Android)\
\--------------------\
1\. Scroll down in the channels list to the bottom of the screen

**Expected**

Ensure that the 2 dots (used for swiping between team sidebar and channels list) do not overlap with the last DM/GM in the channels list. There should also be an overlay behind the dots.
