## MM-T451: Send a DM to someone on no team

---

**Step 1**

Send a DM to someone on no team\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in as User A, and leave all teams\
\- NOTE: You will NOT be able to re-join private channels without being invited to them, so use a test account you don't mind having lose all their channels\
\- Main Menu > Leave Team for each team you are on\
\
2\. Log in as User B and send User A a direct message\
3\. Have User A re-join one of the teams

_Important notes about this step:_

Note: Removed a vague "expected" at the good suggestion of the contributor working on this test case. :) For posterity it was:\
\
If User A is still logged in and viewing the Team Selection page, (depending on notifications settings), they may get a desktop notification, and clicking it may join their most recent team or may show error page "Team Not Found" depending on team settings

**Test Data**

Asked UX re: rejoining open team or not (no reply yet):\
<https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/pl/jtq6dj3am3daxpstedqun5jcyw>

**Expected**

From User B's perspective, message sends. The DM appears in your LHS / channel drawer even though other user isn't on any teams\
\
After User A rejoins a team, the DM channel is visible to them in their LHS / channel drawer
