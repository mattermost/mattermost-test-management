---

**Step 1**

Close DM you're viewing, redirects to last viewed channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. View a DM channel
2. In the LHS click the `x` next to the DM you're viewing
3. View another DM channel
4. Click on DM channel header and select "Close Direct Message"

**Expected**

After 2 and 4, DM is removed from the LHS and center channel redirects to last viewed channel

---

**Step 2**

1. Open a DM to view, click on x to close a different DM (not the one you are currently viewing)

**Expected**

- User remains on the same DM
- The other DM is closed

---

**Step 3**

**Note**:This test case (T453) is set to be run on both the Desktop app as well as a browser in mobile view. If you are testing on the Desktop app please pass this step without testing as it doesn't apply to the Desktop app.

1. Open a DM
2. Trim URL to only show root and reload
