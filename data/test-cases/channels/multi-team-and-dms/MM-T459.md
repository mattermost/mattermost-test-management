## MM-T459: Group Messaging: Add first user

---

**Step 1**

Group Messaging: Add first user\
\--------------------\
1\. Scroll to the foot of the DIRECT MESSAGES list and click `More` (RN apps: Tap `+` next to Direct Messages)\
2\. Start typing a username in the search bar, observe user list filtered, still in alpha order\
3\. Select an autocomplete option by using arrow buttons and pressing Enter (mobile just tap a selection; no arrow buttons on mobile)

**Test Data**

Open ticket for alpha order: <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18186>

**Expected**

\- After step 3: Selected username appears in the search box to the left of the cursor with an "x" for deletion\
\- Selected user no longer appears in user list (except for RN apps; still appears)\
\- Focus is still in search box\
\- Search term disappears\
\- User list is no longer filtered (but still alpha order)\
\- (N/A for RN apps:) Message says "You can add 6 more people."
