## MM-T460: GM: Add and remove more users while creating new GM

---

**Step 1**

GM: Add and remove more users while creating new GM\
\--------------------\
1\. Follow steps in previous test to add first user to a GM, then add additional users to the GM like so:\
2\. Use mouse to click another user from the list\
3\. Type in the search box to filter user list\
4\. Use mouse to click another user from the filtered list\
5\. Use mouse to select any other user from the non-filtered list\
6\. Click the "x" next to one of the usernames in the search box\
7\. With focus in search box, press Backspace to delete the last added user

**Expected**

After each user selection: User added in search box, message saying "You can add 6 more people" increments down by one. Selected user no longer appears in user list, and list is no longer filtered\
\
After each time a user is removed from search box: Deleted user disappears from search box, and message saying "You can add 4 more people" increments up by one
