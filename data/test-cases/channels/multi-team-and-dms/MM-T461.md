## MM-T461: RN apps: All search results are available when the keyboard is showing

**Precondition**

**Test on a server with many users (probably not rc.test), such as postgres.test or mysql.test**

---

**Step 1**

RN - All search results are available when the keyboard is showing\
\--------------------\
**\*\*Test on a server with many users (probably not rc.test), such as postgres.test or mysql.test\*\***\
1\. Open "New Conversation" by tapping "+" next to "DIRECT MESSAGES"\
2\. Enter a couple of characters to search for a user, ensuring more than a screenful worth of results\
3\. Attempt to scroll the list with the search term still present

**Test Data**

\*\*Test on a server with many users (probably not rc.test), such as postgres.test or mysql.test\*

**Expected**

The current expected behavior is to hide the keyboard with any user interaction. For this test, the keyboard should hide as soon as the user beigns scrolling.\
\
\
Previous expected behavior for the test was incorrect: Can scroll list to the bottom and interact with all results (the bottom of the list doesn't get 'stuck' under an open keyboard)
