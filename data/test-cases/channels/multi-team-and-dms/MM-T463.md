## MM-T463: GM: Maximum users

---

**Step 1**

GM: Maximum users\
\--------------------\
1\. Add 7 users to the same GM (but don't Save yet)\
2\. Non-RN: Verify says "You can add 0 more people" and also "You've reached the maximum number of people for this conversation. Consider creating a private channel instead."\
3\. Try to click another user from the list or use arrows to highlight a user and press Enter\
4\. Verify additional user is not added to the list at the top\
5\. Save / Start to open GM channel\
6\. Click channel name > Add Members (still says you can add zero members)\
7\. Backspace or click "x" next to a username to remove it from the GM

**Expected**

After last step, message says "You can add 1 more person."\
Also says "This will start a new conversation. If you're adding a lot of people, consider creating a private channel instead."\
\
Desktop Only:\
Ensure that "Write to..." text in main input box is truncated and does not wrap if all of the names are too long\
\
(Can then add another user and Save to open the GM)
