## MM-T465: GM: Create GM and post message (what message sender sees)

---

**Step 1**

GM: Create GM and post message (what message sender sees)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Add at least two users to a GM, ensuring that it's the first message to that exact group of users (include at least one other user you can log in as)

2. Click Go / tap Start\
   After step 2:

   - Loading indicator displays
   - New group message channel displays:
   - RN apps say "This is the start of your group message history with these teammates. Messages and files shared here are not shown to people outside this area."
   - Webapp / desktop app say "This is the start of your group message history with user1, user2 and user3. Messages and files shared here are not shown to people outside this area."
   - Each user's profile picture displays, and can be clicked / tapped to display popover (with all the usual functions)

3. Type a message and post it.

**Test Data**

Can add specific test for changing Teammate Name Display:\
<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-20006>

**Expected**

\=- Channel name is based on names of users in the GM: all users in the group (except the user viewing it) in alpha order (truncated if necessary, in LHS Channel list and Channel name at the top)\
\
LHS / Channel drawer\
\- Number of members (other than you) appears in a small Square to the left of GM Channel name\
\- GM name appears in DM Channel list in alpha order based on the first name listed, based on Teammate name display
