## MM-T469: Post a mention in a GM (in-channel)

---

**Step 1**

Post a mention in a GM (in-channel)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Have another user open a GM with you and at least one other user
2. Have that user post a message in the GM that @-mentions your user

**Expected**

- You see a Number badge showing an unread mention in that GM Channel
- You receive notifications (desktop, email, mobile push) based on account settings
