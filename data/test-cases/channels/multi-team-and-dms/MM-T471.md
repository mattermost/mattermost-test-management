## MM-T471: Add reactions to message in GM

---

**Step 1**

**Cypress:** Add reactions to message in GM\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

- Login as userOne and town-square

- Switch to the GM

- Post a message

- Click the add reaction icon

- Choose "slightly\_frowning\_face" emoji

  - The number shown on the reaction is incremented by 1
  - Verify that the Add a Reaction button is visible at the right times
  - Verify that the Add Reaction button isn't visible

- Focus on the post since we can't hover with Cypress

  - Verify that the Add Reaction button is now visible

- Click somewhere to clear the focus

  - Verify that the Add Reaction button is no longer visible

- Resize window to mobile view

  - Verify that the Add Reaction button is once again visible

**NOTE: Rainforest manual test**\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post a message in a GM channel
2. Click the emoji reaction picker and select a reaction to add
3. Click the reply arrow to open reply thread in RHS (no need to post a reply)
4. Hover over the root post to see reaction `+` plus sign icon next to the existing reaction, click the plus sign, and select another emoji reaction from the picker
5. Narrow the Desktop app window and verify plus sign is still present next to existing reaction (hover not needed in narrow mobile view)

**Expected**

- Emoji reactions display on the post
- Plus sign to add additional reactions remains visible regardless of the browser width
- Add a Reaction button should be visible when hovering the post or when in mobile view
