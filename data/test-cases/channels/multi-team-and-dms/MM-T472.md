## MM-T472: GM: Add a channel header

---

**Step 1**

GM: Add a channel header\
\--------------------\
1\. When no GM channel header/description is set, click `Add a channel description` just below the channel name, or RN apps tap the channel name and tap Edit Channel.\
2\. Type in a header for the channel and click or tap `Save`

**Expected**

The text is saved and appears at the top of the center panel below channel name, or for RN apps in Info panel (tap channel name)\
\
Channel is marked as read for the current user, and marked as unread for other user\
\
A system message is posted in the channel notifying users the Channel Header was updated (other users see unread indicated).\
\
The system message shows option to delete for the user who triggered it, either on clicking the \[...] menu or long-pressing the post (RN apps)
