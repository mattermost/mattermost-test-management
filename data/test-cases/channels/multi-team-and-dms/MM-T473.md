## MM-T473: GM: Edit channel header

---

**Step 1**

GM: Edit channel header\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Open an existing GM channel that already has a header set
2. Click or tap the channel name at the top of the channel
3. Click "Edit Channel Header" or RN apps tap "Edit Channel"
4. Type in a header for the channel and click or tap "Save"

**Expected**

- The text is saved and appears at the top of the center panel to the right of channel name, or for RN apps in Info panel (tap channel name)
- A system message is posted in the channel notifying users the Channel Header was updated (other users see unread indicated).
- The system message shows option to delete for the user who triggered it, either on clicking the \[...] menu or long-pressing the post (RN apps)

**Step 2**

Edit the channel header to include your username (with the @ symbol)
