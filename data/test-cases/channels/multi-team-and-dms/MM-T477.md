## MM-T477: Remove GM from LHS and re-add through CTRL/CMD+K channel switcher

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create a group message channel, observe it in your channel list\
2\. Remove that group message channel from sidebar by clicking "x"\
3\. Press CTRL/CMD+K to open channel switcher\
4\. Type the first few characters in a user in that GM

**Expected**

Group message channel appears in autocomplete list\
\
Clicking the result in the autocomplete list opens the GM in center channel, and also adds it back to the LHS channel list
