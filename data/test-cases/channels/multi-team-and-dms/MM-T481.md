## MM-T481: User count is updated if user automatically joins channel

---

**Step 1**

User count is updated if user automatically joins channel\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in and view Off-Topic channel\
2\. Main menu > Invite People > Copy Link, close Invite screen\
3\. Open a different / incognito browser, paste the invite link, and sign up for new account\
4\. Go back to first user and observe user count at top of Off-Topic channel on the member icon

**Expected**

The number of users should update once the new user joins the channel and should appear the same in both windows for both users
