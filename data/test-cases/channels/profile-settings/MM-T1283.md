## MM-T1283: Do not let users type Profile input fields longer than the max length for that field

**Precondition**

Run these tests on <https://mysql.test.mattermost.com/>

**Step 1**

1. Navigate to User menu ➜ Profile ➜ Profile Settings ➜ Full Name
2. Attempt to type or paste in a string of more than 64 characters in length in both the First and Last name fields

**Note**: You can use the 66 count string of text on the test data field to the right. When you paste it in it should truncate to only 64 characters
