## MM-T2056: Username changes when viewed by other user

---

**Step 1**

Username changes when viewed by other user\
——————————————————————\
1\. Post a message in Town Square\
3\. In another browser/incognito tab, log in as another user and view Town Square\
4\. Click the first user's profile pic to open their profile popover, observe username\
5\. Back to first user, go to User menu > Profile > Profile Settings > Username > Edit\
6\. Enter a new username\
7\. Save\
8\. 2nd user: Observe first user's post and click profile pic again to view profile popover

**Expected**

2nd user sees updated user1's username in center channel on post\
\
(Se verifies by logging out and back in as other user, not by watching simultaneously)
