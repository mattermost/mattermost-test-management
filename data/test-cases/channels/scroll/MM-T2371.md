---

**Step 1**

Editing a post\
————————————————————————————

1. As the test user open the channel and scroll up from the channel a bit
2. As another user open edit modal for one of your posts that is not on screen for the test user
3. View the thread as the test user while saving the edit

**Expected**

- The thread does not move when the offscreen post changes height
