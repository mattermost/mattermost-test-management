## MM-T2386: No scroll position jumping when more posts are loaded

---

**Step 1**

No scroll position jumping when more posts are loaded\
————————————————————————————

1. Load more posts on web with Safari or Firefox by scrolling to the top

_Related ticket(s):_

[Safari and FF takes an extra frame for scroll correction causing jump to the right post when loading more posts — MM-14791](http://14791)

**Expected**

- Scroll correction happens as soon as new posts load and there's no "jumping"
