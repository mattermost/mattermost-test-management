## MM-T586: before: omits results on and after target date

---

**Step 1**

Before: omits results on and after target date\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Locate a target post and note the date
2. Locate or create a more recent post with some of the same text
3. Search for the text common to both posts
4. Add "before:" to your search term(s) and specify the date that the post from step 2 occurred on

- (Cannot Reproduce) [Date Picker is not displayed when user types "before:" in the search input — MM-21586](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-21586)

**Expected**

- The calendar appears just as you complete typing "Before:"
- Both posts are visible
- Only the post from step 1 is visible - "before:" is not inclusive
