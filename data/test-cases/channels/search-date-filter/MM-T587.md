## MM-T587: after: omits results before and on target date

---

**Step 1**

1. Locate a target post and note the date
2. Locate or create a more recent post with some of the same text
3. Search for the text common to both posts
4. Add "after:" to your search term(s) and specify the date that the post from step 1A occurred on

(**Story**) [Cypress: Search Date Filter tab â€” MM-15699](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15699)

**Expected**

On step 3, both posts are visible.\
On step 4, only the post from step 1B is visible - "after:" is not inclusive.
