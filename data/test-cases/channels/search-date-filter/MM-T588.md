## MM-T588: on: omits results before and after target date

**Step 1**

1. Locate a target post and note the date
2. Locate or create a more recent post with some of the same text
3. Search for the text common to both posts

On: omits results before and after target date\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Add "on:" to your search term(s) and specify a date that is between the date of the 2 posts.
2. Change the date for "on:" to be the date the first post occurred on.
