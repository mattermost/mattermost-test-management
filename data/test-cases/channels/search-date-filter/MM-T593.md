## MM-T593: Use before:, after:, from:, and in: together in one search

---

**Step 1**

Use before:, after:, from:, and in: together in one search\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Locate a target post and note the date, author and channel
2. Build a search query with ":before" date set after the post (this can be in the future if the post occured today) and "after:" date set before the post
3. Add "from:" and specify the author as well as "in:" to specify the channel
4. Run the search (ex:"test in:somechannelname from:someusername after:2018-01-01 before:2018-02-01")
