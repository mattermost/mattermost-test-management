## MM-T595: Changing timezone changes day search results appears

---

**Step 1**

Timezone\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Search for the word "Excelsior!" on [community-release](https://community-release.mattermost.com) (or use the links in the test data field)

   1. Note: join \~public-test-channel where this post exists so you can find it in search

2. Go to Account Settings ➜ Display ➜ Timezone and set your timezone to "Asia/Tashkent"\
   **Note**: That alternate timezone works if you're located on the East coast of the US so you may have to choose a different one to get the posts to land at/around midnight.

3. Repeat the same search

4. Adjust date filter using "before:". "After:" etc. in turn.

**Test Data**

Direct links to the target posts:

- [Directly before midnight](https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/pl/c6tycismzbr8iynh9qcowf54oe)
- [Midnight](https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/pl/m1qjuae6jfrwj8x8ds75b1xsdr)
- [One minute after midnight](https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/pl/ogdjj8f16b8sujt5zbunhqnqcc)

**Expected**

- Changing timezones such that a post now occurs on a different day will be correctly reflected in the search
- **On:** works from 12:00am to 11:59pm
