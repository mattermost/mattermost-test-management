**Step 1**

1. Post a message with a unique word (ex. foobarbaz)
2. Search for the unique word without a leading hyphen
3. Search for the unique word with a leading hyphen (like "-foobarbaz")

- On step 2, search result with the unique word should appear in search results
- On step 3, your post with the unique word should not appear in search results
