**Step 1**

Negative after: filter\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post a message with a unique word (ex. foobarbaz)
2. Search for the unique word and with a filter of "after:YESTERDAYS\_DATE" (YESTERDAYS\_DATE should be selected via the date picker).
3. Search for the unique word with a negative filter of "-after:YESTERDAYS\_DATE" (YESTERDAYS\_DATE should be selected via the date picker).
