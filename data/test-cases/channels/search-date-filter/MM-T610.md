## MM-T610: Negative from: filter

**Step 1**

Negative from: filter\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post a message with a unique word (ex. foobarbaz)
2. Search for the unique word and with a filter of "from:POST\_USER" (POST\_USER should be the user that submitted the post in step 1).
3. Search for the unique word with a negative filter of "-from:POST\_USER" (POST\_USER should be the user that submitted the post in step 1).
