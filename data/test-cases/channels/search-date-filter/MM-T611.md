**Step 1**

Negative on: filter\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Post a message with a unique word (ex. foobarbaz)
2. Search for the unique word and with a filter of "on:TODAYS\_DATE" (TODAYS\_DATE should be selected via the date picker).
3. Search for the unique word with a negative filter of "-on:TODAYS\_DATE" (TODAYS\_DATE should be selected via the date picker).
