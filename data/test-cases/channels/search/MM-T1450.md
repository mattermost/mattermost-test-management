**Expected**

After step 1,\\

- There will be a faint glow around the Search Options list that appears
- If using a dark theme it's even more pronounced
- This is expected

\
After step 4,\\

- You should be able to scroll through autocomplete list in search using mouse/touchpad, as well as using up/down keyboard shortcuts.
- Selected item is added to search box on Enter

After step 5,\\

- The autocomplete vanishes and is replaced by the search hint list

After step 7,\\

- A space is added to the end of the search string
- The autocomplete vanishes
- Pressing enter again will perform the search
- Selecting the suggested channel from the list will also close the autocomplete list

After step 8,\\

- Autocomplete suggestions show both the channel name alone as well as in parenthesis\
  (e.g., "in:town square \~town-square")

After step 9,\\

- `in:\[channel name]` is added to the search box alone as shown below and not the hyphenated name (e.g., "in:town square \~town-square") that you observed in the list as it populated while you typed.
