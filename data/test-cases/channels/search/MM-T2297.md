————————————————————————————\
1\. Search for `from:` followed by a space (or any beginning of username that results in multiple auto-complete options)\
2\. Press down and up arrow keys to move through list

**Expected**

1\. Highlighted option changes\
2\. An option is not selected, so search term stays incomplete
