  "updateNotes": "03/25/2024 (LM) - Not sure why it still isn't working; I can't repro what the RF testers saw, but I see in their videos that they did not get an empty recent mentions page even when using rainforest-guest. Moving this test to manual testing instead.<br /><br />Notes from RF test case:<br />02/29/2024 (LM) - I'm going to try hard-coding the user login to use rainforest-guest, as it seems less likely that that user will have any mentions. If *that* continues to fail we can disable this test and add this test case to manual testing.<br /><br />09/02/24 - Going to try to re-enable this test again as it does pass if there are no mentions for the user yet. However, if it keeps failing, disable and archive.<br /><br />Note: 07/18/2022<br />The test is disabled for the same reasons as the V1 and V2 Android and V1 iOS tests:<br />The recent mentions function is now across teams and it'll be rare that a user does not have any mentions on the RF server. If there are mentions, the test will fail."
