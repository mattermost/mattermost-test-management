## MM-T349: Confirm that search box changes to just an icon / button when decreasing screen size to mid-way between full and mobile view

---

**Step 1**

1. Once logged in, start with your screen at full view
2. While observing the search input box, slowly decrease the size of your view to mid-way between full and mobile view

**Expected**

At about 3/4 full size, you should notice that the search input box becomes just an icon/button
