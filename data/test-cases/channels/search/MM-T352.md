## MM-T352: Once erased/cleared, search term should not reappear as RHS is opened and closed

---

**Step 1**

1. Place the focus in the search box
2. Search for something, e.g. "test"
3. Backspace to clear the search result (or click on the "X" to the right of the search input box)
4. Close the search sidebar
5. Verify the search term does not reappear in the search input box (it is still cleared)
6. Click the pin icon to open the pinned posts RHS

**Expected**

- Search term input box is still cleared
- Search term does not reappear when RHS opens
