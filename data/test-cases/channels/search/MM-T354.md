## MM-T354: No unexpected highlighting when searching with double quotes

---

**Step 1**

1. In a test channel, post the paragraph to the right:

2. Search for the following: (that's 2 quotes at the end)

   - test tool ""

**Test Data**

do you know a tool for detecting SQLi in a whole website¬ø? I mean, I want it to crawl it and then just test a few payloads (', %27, waitfor delay '0:0:05') , and detect which URL, parameter is vulnerable. Best thing I found is this thing https\://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-sql-injection.html but doesn't work like a charm

**Expected**

- The message you just posted should be returned in search results with the words "test" and "tool" highlighted.
- The URL should NOT be highlighted.
