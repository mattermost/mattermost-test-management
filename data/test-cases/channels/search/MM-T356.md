## MM-T356: RN apps: Hashtags

---

**Step 1**

RN apps: Hashtags\
\--------------------\
1\. In a test channel, make the following individual posts:\
\#TEST\
\#QA-testing\
\#hello-world\
\
2\. Also make the following post:\
\- #ab\
\- #123\
\
After making the above posts, tap on each hashtag and observe the search results (see expected)\
\
3\. Search for the text of a hashtag such as "123"\
\
4\. View a hashtag in a channel and select it

**Test Data**

FIXED v1.25 https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19045

**Expected**

For 1) all hashtags should be highlighted and returned in Search\
\
For 2) none of these hashtags should be highlighted or tappable (2-character and followed by numbers don't work)\
\
In the search results screen, you should see an "X" (Android) or "Cancel" (iOS) button to the right of the hashtag at the top of the screen\
\
For 3) Ensure that reply thread loads properly when selecting reply from search results.\
\
For 4) Selecting the hashtag will search for the hashtag as it does in 3)\
\
Note: the keyboard should not engage between tapping on a hashtag and then displaying search results
