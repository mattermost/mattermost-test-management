## MM-T359: Hashtags are not case sensitive for elasticsearch

---

**Step 1**

Hashtags are not case sensitive for elasticsearch\
\--------------------\
\*\*Test this on mysql.test.mattermost.com\*\*\
\
1\. On an environment with Elasticsearch enabled, such as mysql.test or community-release, make the following posts:\
\- `#CASE`\
\- `#Case`\
\- `#case`\
2\. Type `#case` in the Search box and press/tap Enter\
\
Desktop/webapp only:\
3\. Hover your mouse over the "x" to the right of the search term in the search box\
4\. Click on the "x"

**Test Data**

\*\*Test this on mysql.test.mattermost.com\*\*\
\
Note: There is automated coverage for similar cases below but this must be tested against Elasticsearch

**Expected**

All 3 hashtags are returned in results\
\
Desktop/webapp only:\
After 3) you should see a tooltip "clear search query"\
After 4) search query should be cleared and search results remain in the RHS
