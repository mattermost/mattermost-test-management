2\. Type some text in the search box but do not press Enter\
3\. Click the Pinned posts icon (not necessary to have any pinned posts in the channel)\
4\. Observe the text still appears in the search box\
5\. Click the Saved posts icon (not necessary to have any saved posts)

**Expected**

Text remains in search box
