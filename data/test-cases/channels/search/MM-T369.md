## MM-T369: Search icon at narrower widths (as opposed to search box)

---

**Step 1**

Search icon at narrower widths (as opposed to search box)\
\--------------------\
1\. Narrow your browser or desktop app width just enough so the search box is replaced by the search icon.\
(FYI this will only happen if the RHS is closed and no text is in the search field)\
2\. Click the search icon, observe search box expands, focus is in search box, help text popover displays\
3\. Type text in the search box and press Enter to perform the search, observe search box stays same size\
4\. Close search results RHS

_Important notes about this step:_

Open UX ticket desktop app: search help text: <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17648>\
\
Won't fix: Removed search term can reappear in narrow width instead of search help text:\
<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13626>

**Expected**

After typing and pressing Enter, search box stays expanded (same size)\
\
After closing the RHS, search box collapses and search icon displays
