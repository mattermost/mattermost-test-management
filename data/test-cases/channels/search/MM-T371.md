## MM-T371: Highlighting doesn't change to what's being typed in the search input box

---

**Step 1**

Highlighting doesn't change to what's being typed in the search input box\
\--------------------\
\
1\. Post "apple banana"\
2\. Search for "apple"\
3\. In the search box, replace "apple" with "banana" but don't hit "search"

**Expected**

The search term that you searched for stays highlighted regardless of what you type in the search box
