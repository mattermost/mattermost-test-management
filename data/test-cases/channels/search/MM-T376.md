## MM-T376: From:user search, using autocomplete

---

**Step 1**

From:user search, using autocomplete\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In search box, type `from:` and the first couple letters of a user's name (For RN, Select the "From:" option)
2. Select a user from the autocomplete list
3. Press Enter
4. Hover your mouse over the "x" to the right of the search term in the search box
5. Click on the "x"

- (Duplicate) [Some usernames do not show up in \`from:\` search autocomplete on daily — MM-26445](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26445)

**Expected**

- Search results return posts from the user you selected
- After 4) you should see a tooltip "clear search query"
- After 5) search query should be cleared and previous search results remain in the RHS
