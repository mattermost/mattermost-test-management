## MM-T377: From:@user search, autocomplete (and does not match email address)

---

**Step 1**

From:@user search, autocomplete (and does not match email address)\
\--------------------\
1\. In search box, type `from:@` and the first couple letters of a user's name, but make sure the `@` is in there (For RN, Select the "From:" option)\
2\. Select a user from the autocomplete list\
3\. Press Enter

**Test Data**

Ticket to implement on RN apps: https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17135

**Expected**

Search box removes `@` and shows `from:username`\
\
Search results display of posts from that user\
\
Note: Expected that `@user` matches username `@user-1` but not email `user\@sample.com`
