## MM-T378: @ recent mention search `x` to clear search term

---

**Step 1**

@ recent mention search\
\
`x` to clear search term\
\--------------------\
1\. Log in on another / incognito browser as another user\
2\. Have that user @-mention you in a channel you belong to\
3\. Have that user post @channel in a test channel you belong to (can create a new channel)\
4\. If your account is set to include your first name in mentions, have the other user post a message containing your first name\
5\. On your account, click the `@` icon to view recent mentions (For Mobile, this is opened from the user menu on the right)\
6\. Hover your mouse over the "x" to the right of the search term in the search box (n/a for RN app)\
7\. Click on the "x" (n/a for RN app)

**Test Data**

Note: Some latency is expected between updating mention keywords on web and seeing update in mobile apps: https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-12567

**Expected**

In the RHS (search results screen for RN), you should see mentions listed for the specific @-mention and your first name (if applicable)\
\
You should not see a mention listed for the @-channel post\
\
Mentions should be highlighted within the post\
\
FOR DESKTOP/WEBAPP ONLY:\
After 6) you should see a tooltip "clear search query"\
\
After 7) search query should be cleared and previous search results remain in the RHS
