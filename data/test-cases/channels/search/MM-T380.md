## MM-T380: Link opens for post that isn't already displaying in center

---

**Step 1**

Link opens for post that isn't already displaying in center\
\--------------------\
1\. Post several messages in a channel\
2\. Post message `asparagus` in that same channel\
3\. Post several more messages after `asparagus`\
4\. Switch to a different channel and refresh\
5\. Search for the term `asparagus`\
6\. Verify the search result is from a different channel than the one you're viewing in center (observe channel name in search results)\
7\. Click Jump next to the search result

**Expected**

Link view opens in the center for that message, in the channel where it had been posted\
\
The posts preceeding and following the permalink post display as well
