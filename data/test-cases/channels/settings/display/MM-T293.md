_Important notes about this step:_

Can separately spot-check things like link text color, buttons, channel sidebar as well, but for this particular test only the Code theme should be changed.

**Test Data**

```
code\
```

**Expected**

- Code theme selection works properly, and selected code theme is reflected in a code block.
- Code theme selection saves properly, and "sticks" after a refresh.
