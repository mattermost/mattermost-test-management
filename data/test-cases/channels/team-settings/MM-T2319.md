## MM-T2319: Description displays as tooltip on list of teams you can join

---

**Step 1**

Description displays as tooltip on list of teams you can join\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Ensure a team that allows users to join has a description\
2\. Log in with an account that is not part of the team\
3\. Go to Mail Menu > Join Another Team\
4\. Click the tooltip next to the team name\
\
(Prep steps if needed:\
1\. Team Settings -> General > Team Description -> Edit\
2\. Enter "testing the team description"\
3\. Set "Allow anyone to join this team"= Yes\
4\. Save)

**Expected**

Team description should appear by clicking the info icon (verify icon looks aligned properly) (mobile: verify description does not go off-screen)
