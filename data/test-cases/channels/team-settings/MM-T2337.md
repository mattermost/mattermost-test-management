## MM-T2337: Messages from a user still display after that user is removed from a team

---

**Step 1**

Messages from a user still display after that user is removed from a team\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Log into a "Member" (non-admin) test account\
2\. Post a message in a private channel\
3\. Post a message in a public channel\
4\. Send a DM to a Team Admin account on that team\
5\. Log out\
6\. Log in as the Team Admin the DM was sent to\
7\. Remove the user from the team\
8\. View all channels where the messages were posted\
\
(Selenium note: already posted messages in step above)

**Expected**

1\. Messages from the removed user still appear\
2\. DM channels with the removed user still exist with the messages
