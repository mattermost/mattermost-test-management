**Step 1**

Team admin cannot add a user to the team if the email domain is enforced and does not match\
————————————————————————————\
1\. On any team, go to Team Settings.\
2\. Set an email domain in "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team", e.g. "mattermost.com".\
3\. Set "Allow any user with an account on this server to join this team" to "Yes".\
4\. As the admin, select "Add Member to Team"\
5\. Locate and select a user who's email does not match the restriction set in step 2.\
6\. Click Add

**Expected**

Admin is informed that the user cannot be added due to email restrictions
