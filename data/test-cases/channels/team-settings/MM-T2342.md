2\. Set an email domain in "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team", e.g. "mattermost.com".\
3\. Set "Allow any user with an account on this server to join this team" to "Yes".\
4\. As the admin, select "Add Member to Team"\
5\. Loacate and select a user who's email does not match the restriction set in step 2.\
6\. Click Add
