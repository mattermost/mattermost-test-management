---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure that Main Menu ➜ Team Settings ➜ Allow any user with an account on this server... is set to `No`
2. Ensure "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team" is blank (i.e. any email address can be invited)
3. Open Main Menu and click `Invite People`
4. Enter an email address you can access (can use your Mm email using a plus sign, like so: `linda+anything\@mattermost.com`)
5. Click `Invite Members`
6. Check your email, and open the email with subject line:
7. \`\[Mattermost] invited you to join Team
8. Open the `Join now` link in a separate / incognito browser
9. Create a new account using the email address you sent the invite to
