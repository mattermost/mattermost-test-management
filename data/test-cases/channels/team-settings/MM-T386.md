## MM-T386: Invite new user to closed team with 'Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team' set to 'mattermost.com'

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure that Main Menu > Team Settings > Allow any user with an account on this server... is set to `No`
2. Ensure "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team" is set to "mattermost.com"
3. Open Main Menu and click `Invite People`
4. Enter an email address you can access (can use your Mm email using a plus sign, like so: `linda+anything\@mattermost.com`)
5. Click `Invite Members`
6. Check your email, and open the email with subject line:
7. \`\[Mattermost] invited you to join Team
8. Open the `Join Team` link in a separate / incognito browser
9. Create a new account using the email address you sent the invite to

[Invite user by email is sending a blank email — MM-33521](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33521)

_Important notes about this step:_

If an email was added as whitelisted and then removed, users will still be active in the team and channel until they are removed.

**Expected**

- New user is viewing Town Square channel of that team and "Welcome to Mattermost" tutorial is displayed in the center channel
