## MM-T387: Try to join a closed team from a NON-mattermost email address via 'Get Team Invite Link' while 'Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team' set to 'sample.mattermost.com'

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure that Main Menu > Team Settings > Allow any user with an account on this server... is set to `No`
2. Ensure "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team" is set to sample.mattermost.com
3. Open Main Menu > Invite People and click `Copy Link` next to the team invite link
4. Open an incognito browser tab or another browser and paste in the link
5. Type in an email address that has a domain different from sample.mattermost.com (e.g. a gmail.com address), a username and password and hit "Enter"
