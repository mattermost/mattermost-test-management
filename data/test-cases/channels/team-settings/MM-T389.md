## MM-T389: Invite new user to closed team with 'Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team' set to an email domain that is NOT 'mattermost.com'

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure that Main Menu > Team Settings > Allow any user with an account on this server... is set to `No`
2. Ensure "Allow only users with a specific email domain to join this team" is set to an email domain that is NOT "mattermost.com" - e.g. gmail.com
3. Open Main Menu and click `Invite People`
4. Enter an email address you can access (e.g. a private gmail.com account)
5. Click `Invite Members`
6. Check your email, and open the email with subject line:
7. \`\[Mattermost] invited you to join Team
8. Open the `Join Team` link in a separate / incognito browser
9. Create a new account using the email address you sent the invite to

**Expected**

- New user is viewing Town Square channel of that team and "Welcome to Mattermost" tutorial is displayed in the center channel

**Note**: If an email was added as whitelisted and then removed, users will still be active in the team and channel until they are removed.
