## MM-T394: Leave team by clicking Yes, leave all teams

---

**Step 1**

**Note**: Before you leave a team, know that you will NOT be automatically added back to channels if you re-join. And you'll need invitations back to private channels. So make sure you're using a test account that doesn't matter.

1. Login as a user in at least 2 teams
2. Select the top team in the team sidebar
3. Open a channel that is not Town Square
4. Click main menu > Leave Team
5. Verify Leave Team modal text:\
   **You will be removed from \[#] public channels and \[#] private channels on this team.** If the team is private you won't be able to rejoin it without an invitation from another team member. Are you sure?
6. Click Yes
7. Repeat until no more teams, observe team selection page

**Test Data**

Example modal help text:\

**Expected**

- User sees list of teams available to join (and/or Create a Team)

---

**Step 2**

1. Refresh the page, then mouse-over the browser tab and observe tab title/label

**Expected**

- Browser tab title/label reads "Mattermost"

**Note**: On Desktop app, the server tab will continue to show the server name

---

**Step 3**

1. Click `Logout` in top left

**Expected**

- User is logged out
