**Precondition**

1. Mattermost server with valid license to support "User Attributes" feature
2. Admin has created Website user attribute with URL validation
3. Test user has Website value set to "<https://example.com>"

---

**Step 1**

Verify that URL validation works properly for user attributes, showing errors for invalid URLs and allowing valid ones.

1. Login as the test user
2. Open profile settings
3. Edit Website field and enter an invalid URL "ftp\://invalid-url"
4. Try to save the changes
5. Observe error message
6. Edit Website field and enter a valid URL "<https://example2.com>"
7. Save the changes

**Expected**

- System shows error message "Please enter a valid url." when invalid URL is entered
- Save button doesn't complete the operation with invalid URL
- Valid URL saves successfully with no error message
