## MM-T5777: Always Display User Attributes With Visibility Set to Always

**Precondition**

1. A test server with valid license to support 'User Attributes'
2. Admin has created user attributes (Department, Location, Title, etc.)
3. A user exists who has no values set for user attributes
4. Two user accounts exist and are members of the same channel

---

**Step 1**

Verify that user attributes with visibility set to "always" are displayed in the profile popover even if they have no value.

1. As an admin, update the visibility of the Title attribute to "always"
2. Login as a user with no user attribute values
3. Go to a channel where the user is a member
4. Post a message to make the user visible in the channel
5. Open the profile popover for the user's post

**Expected**

- The Title attribute is displayed in the profile popover even though it has no value
- The Title attribute label is visible
- Other attributes with default visibility (when\_set) are not displayed since they have no values
