## MM-T5779: Verify Phone and URL Attributes Are Clickable in Profile Popover

**Precondition**

1. A test server with valid license to support 'User Attributes'

2. Admin has created user attributes including:

   - Phone (phone type field with value "555-123-4567")
   - Website (URL type field with value "<https://example.com>")

3. Test user has values set for these user attributes

4. User is a member of a channel

---

**Step 1**

Verify that phone and URL type user attributes are clickable in the profile popover.

1. Login as the test user
2. Go to a channel where the user is a member
3. Post a message to make the user visible in the channel
4. Open the profile popover for the user's post
5. Check that the Phone attribute is displayed as a clickable link
6. Check that the Website attribute is displayed as a clickable link

**Expected**

- The Phone attribute value is displayed as a clickable link with the tel: protocol (tel:555-123-4567)
- The Website attribute value is displayed as a clickable link with the https: protocol (<https://example.com>)
- Hovering over these links shows they are clickable (e.g., cursor changes to pointer)
- The links are properly formatted and functional
