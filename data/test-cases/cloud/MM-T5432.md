## MM-T5432: Expand License | Should not show annual deprication banner to selected clients

---

**Step 1**

1. Create new account on test portal (<https://portal.test.cloud.mattermost.com/cloud/signup>, for sake of testing)
2. Purchase a `Professional` subscription.
3. Log into Stripe account. Switch to Test mode. Search for the customer that just signed up.
4. Get into subscriptions detail page and update the subscription to become monthly (add a product that has monthly price and update the product ID in the subscription metadata )
5. Verify on the Mattermost instance that the User can see global banners suggesting to move to Annual subscription
6. On Stripe, add a metadata `billing-type: internal` or `billing-type: licensed` and wait for 5 mins.
7. Reload the Mattermost instance and Verify the banner is not visible anymore.
