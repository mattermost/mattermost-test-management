## MM-T403: Email address already in use

---

**Step 1**

Email address already in use\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. After creating a new user, log out of that server
2. Click to Create a new user
3. Enter the same email address you already used to create an account
4. Enter any username and any password and click to create the account

**Expected**

- Error message displays below the Create Account button that says "_An account with that email already exists_"
- From there you can just click the Back link in top left and abandon that account creation
