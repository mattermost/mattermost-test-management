## MM-T3415: Cloud Trial — Create Workspace (details)

---

**Step 1**

1. Click "Terms" link at bottom of page
2. Click "Privacy Policy" link at bottom of page
3. Change URL to https\://portal.test.cloud.mattermost.com/cloud
4. Observe Workspace URL pre-filled with Organization name used when you created the account
   \
   **Note**: If you used an organization name with spaces then the URL will replace the spaces with hyphens
5. Replace the URL with a reserved subdomain such as "about" or "contact" (full list available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRPQL5SDdarBrfiaPsghXt8f6poAQINTtECRDIu4s2Q/edit#gid=1661056402&range=A2))
6. Try a variety of URLs that break the rules including trying to use an existing Workspace such as "longtermbilling"
   \
   **Note**: Your workspace name must be at least 3 and a maximum of 60 characters, must start with a letter, must use lowercase letters, numbers and dashes and can’t end in a dash
7. Click the "Contact Support" link in the error that appears below the URL when you use a reserved subdomain
8. Edit URL to MonthDayYear format used when you created the account for easy future use when reviewing previously created accounts
   \
   (e.g., October1920)
9. Click "Logout" in top right corner
10. Log back in
11. Click "Start Collaborating" button
12. Reduce size of window vertically as it creates the workspace

- After 3: Redirected to <https://portal.test.cloud.mattermost.com/cloud/create-workspace>

- Need to edit once MM-29824 is fixed ➜ After 7: Redirected to Support URL or email composition window

- After 8: URL accepted ("Good news! This URL is available." appears below URL field)

- After 10: Returned to Workspace creation page

- During 10: The "Preparing your workspace" text and progress bar do not merge with or float through the helper text displayed on the screen as the workspace is created

- After 12:

  - The workspace is created successfully and you land on https\://**\[MonthDayYear or name you chose]**.test.mattermost.cloud/main/channels/town-square with the 3 step"Welcome to Mattermost" steps displayed
  - You receive an email ("You joined **\[MonthDayYear or name you chose]**.test.mattermost.cloud") that contains a link and information about the new Workspace but _**does not**_ contain a button to verify your email address as you previously did so when you created the account on the portal
