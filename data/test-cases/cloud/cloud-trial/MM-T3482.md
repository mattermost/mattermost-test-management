## MM-T3482: Cloud Trial — Reserved domain checks

---

**Step 1**

1. Create a cloud account with a non-mattermost email address
2. Try to create a workspace with reserved domain names: google, yahoo, alipay...
3. Create a cloud account with a free email address
4. Create a cloud account with your mattermost email address

**Expected**

- After 2, you should receive a suggestion with the -1 (e.g., google-1, yahoo-1, etc.) and you're not able to get it to accept the domain directly
- After 3, same behavior as before
- After 4, you should be able to pick reserved domains as Mattermost email accounts are exempt from the DNS checks
