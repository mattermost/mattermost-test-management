[CWS - completed Company Information screen reads "Provide your company name and address" — MM-30966](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-30966)

**Expected**

- After 1, an empty "There is currently no company information on file" screen is shown with a button and a link to add company information

- After 2,

  - both the button and the link work
  - the "Edit Company Information" form appears

- During 3,

  - you're able to fill out he fields and save without having to use the optional number of employees field
  - once you save it brings you back to the (now completed) Company Information screen
