  - if you type in a wrong number the boxes will animate to let you know it's the wrong code
  - if you click "Not getting the email? Resend verification code" it will provide you with a new email and code while invalidating the previous code

  - If you replace the suggested URL (based upon the company name you typed in) in an unacceptable URL (e.g., a previously used URL, support, about, only 1 character, an expletive, etc.) then it won't allow you to continue\\

  - once your Workspace is ready you'll receive an email notifying you that it's ready to go with the subject line "Congratulations!"
