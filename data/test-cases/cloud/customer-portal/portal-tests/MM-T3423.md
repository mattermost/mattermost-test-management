- [Re-typing the verification code from the beginning causes the page to submit with each key stroke — MM-30418](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-30418)

**Expected**

- After 1,

  - You land on the **First, let's create an account** page
  - Step 1 (Create an account) on the left shows as the current step
  - Step 2 (Choose Subscription) is grayed out and incomplete
  - Step 3 (Billing & Payment) is grayed out and incomplete
  - The 'Next' button remains inactive until all fields are filled in and the check box indicating that you agree to the privacy policy has been checked you're brought to an email verification page

- After 2,

  - You receive the email with a code
  - The account form changes to a 6 box field awaiting your code\

- After 3,

  - You receive an email for each time you clicked the "Resend verification code" link
  - Check that one of the previous verification codes doesn't verify your account
  - You can paste or type the code in

- During 4, the entire form is erased and an error appears\

- After 5,

  - The last (valid) code works
  - Once accepted the page changes quickly to the **Next, choose a subscription** page\

---

**Step 2**

1. Type in an invalid code 11 times

  (resending the code resets the count)
