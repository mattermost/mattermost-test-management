## MM-T3432: Portal - Password change

---

**Step 1**

1. Open the portal on a normal tab and on an incognito tab or another browser
2. Go to the Password page at <https://portal.test.cloud.mattermost.com/console/password> on the regular tab
3. Change your password among other fields on that page if you'd like
4. Try to move through the portal without verifying the password change
5. Try to navigate around the portal on the incognito tab or other browser where you're logged into that same account
6. Verify the password change via the link in the email you received
7. After logging back in logout and try again using your previous password
