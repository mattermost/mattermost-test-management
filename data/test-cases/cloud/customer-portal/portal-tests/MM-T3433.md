## MM-T3433: Portal - Company Information

---

**Step 1**

1. Verify overall functionality and appearance of Company Information page
2. Rename the Company name to something very long (e.g., TheGreatBigCompanyNameThatSeemsToGoOnForeverAndEverAsIfItWillNeverEnd)

**Expected**

- Company Name field

- Company Address

  - Toggling "Same as billing address" checkbox reveals & hides billing address vs. fields to fill in different address

    - Country dropdown
    - Two address fields
    - City
    - State dropdown
    - Zip/Postal code
    - Update & cancel buttons

- After 2, the name is truncated and does not wrap to a new line at the top of the screen
