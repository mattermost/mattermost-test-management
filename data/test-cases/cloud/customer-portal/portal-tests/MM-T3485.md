## MM-T3485: Portal - Standard page links

---

**Step 1**

1. On any portal page click the following links in any order:

   - Contact Us
   - Subscription Terms
   - Privacy Policy
     \
     **Note**: These first 3 links can be found on nearly every page in the portal

2. The link in the top right corner changes between three different purposes dependent upon whether or not you are logged in or have an account yet or not

   - Log In
   - Create an Account
   - Log Out
