## MM-T4021: License generator tests

**Objective**

Verify functionality of the admin license generator

**Precondition**

In order to test this you'll need to have an email address you use promoted to admin on both the dev and test environments.

---

**Step 1**

1. Log into the portal (on test or dev as needed) using the email address you've reserved for testing license generation\
   **Note**: It can be any email address you have but needs to be promoted to admin by a member of the Cloud features team in order for it to work

2. Go to the license generator page:

   - **Test environment:** <https://portal.test.cloud.mattermost.com/admin/license>
   - **Dev environment:** <https://portal.dev.cloud.mattermost.com/admin/license>

3. Type in the email address you use for that portal account

4. Select a type of license from the dropdown menu (E10 or E20)

5. Check off if it is a trial or not

6. Type in the number of users

7. Edit the start and end dates

8. Click the **Issue License** button

9. Download the license attached to the email you received

10. Upload the license to the proper server for testing:

    - [Dev environment](https://mattermost-server-pr-16787.test.mattermost.cloud/admin_console/about/license)
    - [Test environment](https://mattermost-server-pr-16778.test.mattermost.cloud/admin_console/about/license)

**Test Data**

**Tip**: Right-click any image to view a larger version in a new tab

**Expected**

- After 2;

  - when you first arrive on the form it will be blank except for the date fields

- After 3;

  - when you tab out of the email address field the Organization and First & Last name fields will fill in automatically based on the information associated with that email address account.

- During 7;

  - you're able to set dates both into the recent past and end them years out ahead in the future for trials and full licenses

- After 8;

  - The \*\*License Generated! **screen**\*\*appears

  - An email arrives in your inbox with the license key attached with one of the two subject lines below (dependent upon whether you selected trial or not):

    - "Your license key for Mattermost Enterprise \[either E10 or E20]"
    - "Your trial license key for Mattermost Enterprise \[either E10 or E20]"

  - Clicking the Issue New License button will return you to the license generator screen with all fields empty (except the date fields)

- After 10;

  - The license uploads successfully
  - The details displayed match the record of the account you used to generate the license with
  - The type and number of users matches what you selected in the license generator form
