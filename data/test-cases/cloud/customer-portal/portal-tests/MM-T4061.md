## MM-T4061: Portal — Renew now button on the Subscriptions console

---

**Step 1**

1. Create an account on the Portal and purchase a license

2. Edit the license via Stripe to set the end date within the next 60 days then return to the portal and refresh the page:

   - Locate the customer you created
   - Click the self-managed subscription
   - Click Actions (top right) and select **Reschedule cancellation**
   - Select a date from the calendar that appears (be sure to make note of the year when you choose the date)

3. Return to the portal and refresh the screen

4. Click the Renew Now button

5. Complete the purchase

_Related ticket(s):_

- (Invalid) [Portal - Editing the cancel date in Stripe doesn't affect the license available for download from the Portal — MM-35810](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-35810)\
  **Note from ticket**: "_This is expected as the license is only generated once at the time the subscription is created. The license payload is stored and never modified regardless of changes in Stripe._"

**Expected**

- After 1;

  - The license appears on the subscription page in the console

- After 2;

  - The renew button appears after a refresh on the portal

- After 3;

  - The renew now button appears

- After 4;

  - The license renew page appears

- After 5;

  - The purchase completes successfully
  - The license no longer shows a renew now button next to it
  - The customer record i Stripe shows the new subscription
