## MM-T4889: Start Trial from Invite users screen

---

**Step 1**

1. On a new Workspace click the link in the LHS to open the invite modal.
2. Click the CTA link
3. Start the trial then click the link to invite members again

**Expected**

- After 1: If the user hasnâ€™t started a trial before a CTA to trial the invite guests is shown (and hovering reveals a tooltip)
- After 2: A modal appears with a button to start the trial
- After 3 (during the trial): It shows that inviting Guests is a Professional feature
