## MM-T4892: Self-Serve: Downgrade from Professional plan

---

**Objective**

<!-- As of the Cloud release on February 2, 2023 new customers will no longer be able to select monthly as a billing option. As such they will not be able to downgrade manually and will instead need to contact support to facilitae downgrading. Grandfathered monthly billed customers will retain the ability to downgrade so for now this test can remain in place. -->
Verify the functionality of the dowgrade mechanism/workflow in monthly billed cloud workspaces.  
**Note:** For more information about this feature refer to the links in the Traceability tab above.

**Precondition**

**Step 1**

1. Upgrade a Workspace to Professional on a monthly plan
2. Create a half dozen teams or so
3. Go to **System Console ➜ Billing & Account ➜ Subscription**
4. Click the **View plans** button
5. Click the **Downgrade** button in the Starter column

**Expected**

- Prompted to select the team you'd like to keep (all other teams will be archived)
- Once complete the Subscription page shows the current plan as Cloud Starter and all access to Professional level features is gone
