## MM-T4892: Self-Serve: Downgrade from Professional plan

**Objective**

Important: As of the Cloud release on February 2, 2023, new customers will no longer be able to select monthly as a billing option. As such they will not be able to downgrade manually and will instead need to contact support to facilitate downgrading. Grandfathered monthly billed customers will retain the ability to downgrade so for now this test can remain in place.

Verify the functionality of the downgrade mechanism/workflow in monthly billed cloud workspaces.

**Note:** For more information about this feature refer to the links in the Traceability tab of this test case located on Zephyr Scale.

**Precondition**

In order to test this you'll need to do the following in order:

1. Create a new Cloud Workspace in the test environment
2. Copy the server address without the `https://` part (e.g., `myserver.test.mattermost.cloud`)
3. Reach out to a developer on the Self-Serve team and explain you need to test downgrading from a monthly subscription

---

**Step 1**

**Note:** The developer you reached out to (as described in the Precondition) may set the Workspace as already subscribed to a Professional plan when they make the changes you need to test this. If so you can skip step 1 below.

1. Upgrade a Workspace to Professional on a monthly plan
2. Create a half dozen teams or so
3. Go to **System Console ➜ Billing & Account ➜ Subscription**
4. Click the **View plans** button
5. Click the **Downgrade** button in the Starter column

**Expected**

- Prompted to select the team you'd like to keep (all other teams will be archived)
- Once complete the Subscription page shows the current plan as Cloud Starter and all access to Professional level features is gone
