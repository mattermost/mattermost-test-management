## MM-T4903: Paid features indicators in System Console

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to the System Console on a Starter plan level Workspace
2. Observe the key (🗝️) icons on items that require a trial or paid upgrade in order to access
3. Hover over the key
4. Start a trial or upgrade to a paid plan

**Expected**

- Hovering over the 🗝️ reveals a tooltip indication that the feature is only available on a trial or paid plan\

- Starting a trial or upgrading removes the 🗝️ and allows use of the feature
