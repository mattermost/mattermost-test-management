## MM-T4960: Message Limit: center channel notification

---

**Step 1**

On a Workspace with the Starter plan in place:

1. Use \*\*/test threaded\_postÂ \*\*to put 1,000 posts at a time in place
2. Do step 1 enough times to hit the 10,000 message limit
3. Go to a different channel (you may also need to refresh the screen)

**Expected**

- A message appears in the center channel regarding unlocking messages
- Clicking the **Upgrade now** button opens the pricing model
