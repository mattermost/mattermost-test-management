**Step 1**

1. Have a dev set the file limit for Starter plans down to 1 GB âžœ 8,589,934,592 via Stripe
2. Create a Workspace or use one already on Starter
3. Upload enough files to push it past the 1 GB limit\
   File (99mb.txt) attached to this test case can be used for this purpose
4. Add whatever bogus metadata to the subscription in Stripe
5. Wait a few minutes then refresh the page
6. Search for one of the files you uploaded
