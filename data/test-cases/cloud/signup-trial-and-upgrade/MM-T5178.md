**Expected**

- Checklist is expanded by default

- It contains links to the following features or steps to take:

  - Tour of channels.
  - Invite team members to the workspace.
  - Explore other tools in the platform.

- A clickable link at the bottom that reads 'No thanks, I'll figure it out myself' dismisses the checklist
