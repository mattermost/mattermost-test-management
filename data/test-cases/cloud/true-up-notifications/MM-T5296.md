## MM-T5296: Display a notice banner only to admins when the instance is in overage users state on Invite Modal.

---

**Step 1**

<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-47775>

Pre-requisites:

- Have a workspace with test self-hosted license that has user less limit for testing purposes
- eg: Assume License has 20 active users limit

Test:

- Log into workspace with admin credentials
- Open invite modal. Verify banner is not shown. Close the modal
- Create 20 (expect current logged in user) users using `/test` cmd. Such that the active users above 5% and below 10% threshold.
- Open invite modal. Verify banner is shown with yellow color and a message, "Your workspace user count has exceeded your paid license seat count by 1 seat. Notify your Customer Success Manager on your next true-up check". Close the modal.
- Create 4 more users (total 25) using `/test` cmd. Such that the active users above 10% threshold.
- Open invite modal. Verify banner is shown with red color and a message, "Your workspace user count has exceeded your paid license seat count by 5 seats. Notify your Customer Success Manager on your next true-up check". Close the modal.
- Verify the banner shouldn't appear if the admin had previously dismissed it.
