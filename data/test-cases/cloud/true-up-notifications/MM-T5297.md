## MM-T5297: System console: Dynamic banner that communicates over-deployment

---

**Step 1**

Ref: <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-47646>

Pre-requisites:

- Have a workspace with test self-hosted license that has user less limit for testing purposes
- eg: Assume License has 20 active users limit

Test:

- Log into workspace with admin credentials.
- Create 20 (expect current logged in user) users using `/test` cmd. Such that the active users above 5% and below 10% threshold.
- Reload the screen. Verify global banner is shown with blue color and a message, "Your workspace user count has exceeded your paid license seat count by 1 seat. Purchase additional seats to remain compliant." The banner should be dismissible.
- Create 4 more users (total 25) using `/test` cmd. Such that the active users above 10% threshold.
- Reload the screen. Verify banner is shown with red color and a message, "Your workspace user count has exceeded your paid license seat count by 5 seats. Purchase additional seats to remain compliant.".
- Verify the banner shouldn't appear if the admin had previously dismissed it.
