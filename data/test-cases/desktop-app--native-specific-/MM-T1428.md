## MM-T1428: Desktop App window returns to 'floating' app position upon restart

---

**Step 1**

1. Resize Desktop app to roughly half width
2. Position window left, right or place it in the center if you're feeling sort of middle of the road today
3. Quit/close app (Mac âŒ˜+Q / CTRL+F4 Windows)
4. Re-open the Desktop app

_Important notes about this step:_

- Original bug was discovered on Windows and fixed. Then it appeared on Mac.

- When testing on Windows you can use the Windows key + left or right arrow to snap the window in place

- When testing on Mac you can use either of the 2 following open source apps or whatever other one you may have installed. ðŸ¤“
