## MM-T1660: App restores position correctly after minimize and launch

**Precondition**

**TWO MONITORS ARE REQUIRED - NOT SUITABLE FOR AUTOMATION**

---

**Step 1**

1\. Add a 2nd monitor

---

**Step 2**

2\. Position the desktop app on a second monitor

---

**Step 3**

3\. Try repositioning the app few times between the windows

---

**Step 4**

4\. Minimize the app and restore on the 2nd display

**Expected**

- App restores to the same position

- For the following cases if the secondary monitor is no longer available app should open on the primary display.

  - After minimizing and restoring the app when the window is being hidden for more than 50% on a secondary monitor, app should open in the center of the same secondary monitor.
  - After minimizing and restoring the app when the window is being hidden for less than 50% on any monitor, app should open in the same position on the same display.

---

**Step 5**

5\. Repeat the step 3 and quit and re-launch

**Expected**

- App restores to the same position

- For the following cases if the secondary monitor is no longer available app should open on the primary display.

  - After quitting and re-launching the app when the window is being hidden for more than 50% on a secondary monitor, app should open in the center of the same secondary monitor.
  - After quitting & re-launching the app when the window is being hidden for less than 50% on any monitor, app should open in the same position on the same display
