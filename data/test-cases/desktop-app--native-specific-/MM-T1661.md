## MM-T1661: Desktop notifications

---

**Step 1**

1. Receive direct mention, thread reply (if enabled for mentions) or DM from a different user

_Related ticket(s):_

- [Windows Desktop notifications are delayed compared to other notification channels — MM-22552](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22552)
- (Won't Fix) [Double notifications received on Ubuntu — MM-26012](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26012)\
  "_This is coming from the OS and we are not able to fix on our end._"

---

**Step 2**

1. Observe the server tab, sidebar channel (LHS) and desktop notification

**Expected**

- Desktop notification, channel mention and tab mention count update at the same time when notification is received.
