## MM-T1430: Clicking a permalink to a post on a different server opens the appropriate post without launching a browser - or creating a new Desktop app window

---

**Step 1**

1. Configure the Desktop app to have both of the following servers:

   - https\://community-daily.mattermost.com/
   - https\://community.mattermost.com/

2. Copy a permalink from a post on community.mattermost.com

3. Post it on a channel (public or private) on community-daily.mattermost.com\
   Or vice versa, it's really up to you. üòè

4. Click the automatically created '\<jump to convo>' link

**Expected**

You're taken to the post as it exists on the server you clicked it on.\
(e.g., the link was originally for community-daily and when you clicked it on community it just opened the link _in community_ instead of switching tabs)\
\
**Note**: The reason this works is when the link you pasted was converted to '\<jump to convo>' it recognized the deeplink and changed the server to match because it's smarter than you and wanted to make it easy on everyone.

---

**Step 2**

1. Post the permalink you created above in step 1A as a markdown link (e.g., \[text]\(permalink) )
2. Click the link

[New Desktop window created after clicking on permalink to channel on different server ‚Äî MM-19919](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19919)

**Expected**

This time it switches to the appropriate server tab as it's not as smart as it thought it was when creating the '\<jump to convo>' link above. üòõ\
\
But most important it doesn't open up the link in a browser which was the point of the bug linked below. Unless of course you missed step 1A above which means you might want to run through all of this again. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
