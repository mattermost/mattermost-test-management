## MM-T1311: Switch applications: Text input is focused within server view (webview)

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure Text input is focused within server view

   - join server
   - open any channel
   - observe textbox input field

2. Alt or Cmd + Tab to another application

3. Alt or Cmd + Tab back to Mattermost desktop app

**Expected**

Previously focused text input is still focused when returning to application
