## MM-T1315: Close Settings screen: Text input is focused within server view (webview)

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure Text input is focused within server view

   - join server
   - open any channel
   - observe textbox input field

2. Ctrl or Cmd + , (comma) to open Settings page

3. Close Settings modal by clicking on the X

**Expected**

- Previously focused text input is still focused when returning to server view from Settings modal
