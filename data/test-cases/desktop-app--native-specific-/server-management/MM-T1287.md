## MM-T1287: Deprecated - Add two servers (from Settings)

---

**Step 1**

Navigate to settings/preferences:\
**Windows**: File ➜ Settings (**CTRL+,**)\
**Mac**: Mattermost ➜ Preferences (**⌘+,**)

1. Add two servers in the "Server Management" section
2. Click the second server on the list

**Expected**

- Clicking on a server on the settings page will load the server.
- Server list in Preferences/Settings does not have to match the tab order
- Servers list in Preferences/Settings is arranged in the order servers were added to the app and it does not change as user manually rearranges the server tabs in the app.
