## MM-T1312: Text input is focused within Add Server modal

---

**Step 1**

1. Open Settings

2. Click on **+ Add New Server**

3. Verify text input is focused within Add Server modal in Settings modal (should be auto focused on the Server name field)

4. Use keyboard shortcuts to switch between applications, navigate away, then back to Mattermost desktop app

   - **Windows**: Alt + Tab
   - **macOS:** Cmd + Tab

**Expected**

- Previously focused text input is still focused when returning to application
- Only on Windows: while on this screen verify right side of the settings modal does not have an added white bar
