## MM-T2634: Server tab Drag and Drop

---

**Step 1**

Open Mattermost Desktop, and make sure you have at least 2 servers listed in the dropdown.

**Expected**

Initial order of server should be the order in which the servers were added.

---

**Step 2**

Drag the first server down below the second one. Then open/close the dropdown.

**Expected**

The second server should now appear above the first one before closing the dropdown and should persist in that order after re-opening.

---

**Step 3**

Close and re-open Mattermost OR open the config.json file.

**Expected**

Server tab order is preserved after restart and/or persisted on disk.
