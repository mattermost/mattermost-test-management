## MM-T2952: Desktop App only (v4.2+) (WINDOWS & LINUX OS ONLY) Change setting for app start on login

---

**Step 1**

NOTE: This test requires logging in and out of Windows\
\
1\. Continuing from the test above, and being logged in to the app,\
2\. Click on "File" then "Settings" and scroll down to "App Settings"\
3\. Deselect "Start App on Login" by clicking in the checkbox (it should already be ticked from the previous test)\
4\. Observe "Saving" then "Saved" in a blue button to the right of "App Settings"\
5\. Quit the app\
6\. Log out of Windows then log in again

**Expected**

Confirm that the app does not auto-launch on login, and after you launch Mattermost manually, "start app on login" is disabled in "File" > "Settings" > "App Settings"
