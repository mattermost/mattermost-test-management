**Step 1**

NOTE: This test requires logging in and out of Windows\
\
1\. Continuing from the test above, and being logged in to the app,\
2\. Click on "File" then "Settings" and scroll down to "App Settings"\
3\. Deselect "Start App on Login" by clicking in the checkbox (it should already be ticked from the previous test)\
4\. Observe "Saving" then "Saved" in a blue button to the right of "App Settings"\
5\. Quit the app\
6\. Log out of Windows then log in again
