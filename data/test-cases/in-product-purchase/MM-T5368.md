**Step 1**

<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-47424>

Pre-requisites:

- Have a workspace with test self-hosted currently on free plan.
- Make sure the instance where feature is being tested had the feature flag 'ServiceSettings.SelfHostedPurchase' enabled
- Instance will also need CloudSettings.CWSURL and CloudSettings.CWSAPIURL.hint: we can use cws-rfqa.test.mattermost.com

Test:

- Follow steps in \<test-1.md> to make a purchase.
- Verify user is able to see Success screen to confirm the purchase.
- Go back to Channels
- From Product switcher option verify user is now able to create User Groups (which is a professional license feature).
