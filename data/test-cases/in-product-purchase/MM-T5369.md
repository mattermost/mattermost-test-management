- Click on "Close" button and verify user is taken to either Channels or System console > Edition and License screen depending upon from where the user started to make purchase.

- On System console > Edition and License screen, verify the instance is still on a "Free" plan and no license is loaded.

  - Verify billing details are not displayed.Note: Since this is the first purchase that admin makes, billing screen will not have any data in case purchase failure

Email Verification
