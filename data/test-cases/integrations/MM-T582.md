---

**Step 1**

Integration attachments - View Jira plugin messages\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**On the mobile app**:\\

1. View the Bugs channel on community-release.mattermost.com
2. Find a Jira message
3. View in center, then view in reply thread
4. If a long enough integration attachment, tap `Show more` to expand post and `Show less` to collapse again

**Expected**

- Verify the content (attachment) displays and you can see the bug description text in both center and reply thread
- If long attachment, can expand and collapse post to view more and less of its content
- The bot that made the post is shown as "jira" with a grey "BOT" label beside
- Bot name is displayed the same in reply thread
