## MM-T662: /join command for private channels

---

**Step 1**

/join private\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Ensure user is member of a private channel
2. From a different channel, type "**/join** \[private-channel]" and post (using the name of the private channel the user is part of, without a tilde \~ preceding it)
3. Then repeat the test, with a tilde \~ preceding it

[Spurious "join private channel" warning — MM-33661](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-33661)

**Expected**

- The private channel is displayed in center
- (If not a member of the private channel, message displays "An error occurred while joining the channel" and channel is not joined/displayed)
