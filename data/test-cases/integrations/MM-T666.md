## MM-T666: /groupmsg error if messaging more than 7 users

---

**Step 1**

1. System error message if add more than 7 people in the command: "Group messages are limited to a maximum of 7 users."

2. Similar to current behavior, the system error message if one or more of the users cannot be found on the system:

   - "We couldn't find the user: @username"
   - "We couldn't find the users: @username, @username2, @username3"

_Important notes about this step:_

The end result of the created group message (or message sent to existing GM) will contain 8 users (the 7 you messaged + yourself)

**Expected**

- If adding more than 7 users (excluding current user), system message saying "Group messages are limited to a maximum of 7 users."
- If users cannot be found, returns error that user(s) could not be found
