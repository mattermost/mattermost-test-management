---

**Step 1**

Start message with slash and non-command\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Type **/notacommand** in center message box
2. Press Enter

**Expected**

- Error message displays "Command with a trigger of '/notacommand' not found. Click here to send as a message."
- Focus remains in the message box and message disappears on Backspace, then reappears again if another invalid command is attempted
- Clicking the link posts the text as a message
