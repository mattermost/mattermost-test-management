## MM-T672: /offline

**Step 1**

1. In any channel, post "/offline"
2. Switch to another channel and then back to the channel you were in in step 1

**Expected**

On step 1, indicator should be grey indicating user is offline.\
On step 2,\\

- No "New Messages" line appears above system message "You are now offline"
- System message should not display online indicator on the profile picture (this is true for all system messages)
