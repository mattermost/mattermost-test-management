## MM-T706: Error Handling for Slash Commands

---

**Step 1**

Error Handling for Slash Commands\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Test Setup**:

1. Get the channel ID of the off-topic channel
2. Add a slash command with any trigger word (could be "error\_handling") with request URL of "https\://slash-url-error-handling-7zcjp6ud59wg.runkit.sh?type=system\_message\&channel\_id=**\[**enter channel ID**]**" and request method of "POST"
3. If request URL is not available, see <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-qa-automation/tree/master/server/release_test_slash> on how to run/deploy.
4. On success, go to a different channel and post a slash command ("/error\_handling")

_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: Be sure to replace the bracketed text (and the brackets as well) with the channel ID you intend to test this in. You can get the channel ID clicking the down arrow and then 'View Info' at the top of the channel.

**Expected**

- 1 message ("Hello World") being posted in off-topic
- 1 message failing to be posted, since `type` is `system\_message`
- Error message "Command 'error\_handling' failed to post response. Please contact your System Administrator." being shown to user
