## MM-T707: Send a message to a different channel than where the slash command was issued from

---

**Step 1**

Send a message to a different channel than where the slash command was issued from\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Test Setup**:\
1\. Get the channel ID of the off-topic channel\
2\. Add a slash command with any trigger word (could be "other\_channel") with request URL of "https\://slash-url-error-handling-7zcjp6ud59wg.runkit.sh?channel\_id=\[enter channel ID]" and request method of "POST"

- If request URL is not available, see https\://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-qa-automation/tree/master/server/release\_test\_slash on how to run/deploy.

3\. On success, go to a different channel and post a slash command ("/other\_channel")
