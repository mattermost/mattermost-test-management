## MM-T1815: Add a Bot to a team that has email restricted.

---

**Step 1**

Add a Bot to a team that has email restricted.\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Enable email domain restriction in the system console under signup with a arbitrary domain name (I've used "planet-express.com" in my tests but anything should do).\
2\. Enable bot account creation\
3\. Create a bot account through the integrations modal\
4\. Try to add the bot to any team on the server

**Expected**

Bot can be sucessfukky added without having an email at a whitelisted domain
