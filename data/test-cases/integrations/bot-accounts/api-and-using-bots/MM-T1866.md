---

**Step 1**

Create two posts in a row to the same channel\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Create a bot post\
2\. Create a 2nd bot post before any othetr user posts to the channel

**Test Data**

curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"channel\_id":"\<Chanel ID>", "message":"This is a message from a bot with mention for @dkh-sysadmin and @dkh-member", "props":{"attachments": \[{"pretext": "Look some text","text": "This is text"}]}}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer \<Token>' \<Server>/api/v4/posts

**Expected**

Even though both posts in a row are made by the same user, the profile image is \*\*not \*\*displayed along with a timestamp for the 2nd post
