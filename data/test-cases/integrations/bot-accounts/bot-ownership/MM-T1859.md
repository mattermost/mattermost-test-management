## MM-T1859: Bot is kept active when owner is disabled

---

**Step 1**

Bot is kept active when owner is disabled\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Create or locate a System Admin\
2\. Set Disable bot accounts when owner is deactivated: to False\
3\. As the sys admin create a BOT account\
4\. As a 2nd admin deactivate the admin that created the BOT\
5\. Go to Integrations>> Bots and locate the bot created in step 2.

**Expected**

\- The bot is still active\
\- All system admins receive a DM **from themselves** listing which bots have no Active owner
