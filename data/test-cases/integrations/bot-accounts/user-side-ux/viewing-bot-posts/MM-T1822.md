## MM-T1822: Long–BOT-name post looks correct in main thread and reply thread

---

**Step 1**

BOT post looks correct in main thread and reply thread\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Create a post from a Bot with very long username (Sample CURL provided) and open a channel\
2\. Note the post authored by the BOT in the main thread\
3\. Click reply on the post and note the post authored by the BOT in the reply thread

**Test Data**

curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"channel\_id":"\<Channel ID>", "message":"This is a message from a bot with mention for @dkh-sysadmin and @dkh-member", "props":{"attachments": \[{"pretext": "Look some text","text": "This is text"}]}}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer \<Token>' \<Server>/api/v4/posts

**Expected**

On 1. and 3.\
\- BOT account has a profile image (default or other)\
\- BOT account has a "BOT" tag\
\- When the username is shown it will truncate before the BOT tag and leave tag visible
