## MM-T2029: 🚀 Postman setup for incoming webhooks integrations tests

---

**Step 1**

**Summary**: These tests are designed to test the ability of an admin to control what usernames & profile pictures are used when an incoming webhook posts to Mattermost.\
**Deep dive**: The [more details version of the summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNx4P3z7Nuf1tcQbt-Ewx7ZitDKT_8EqoAdrqc6QYjc/edit?usp=sharing) if you're itching to look under the hood and understand all of this better.\
\
**Really important time saver notes you really shouldn't overlook**:

- Run these tests on <https://postgres.test.mattermost.com> as many of the links embedded within the tests go directly to locations on that server to streamline testing.
- Oh! And you'll want to use the "Webhooks" team invite link in case you're not already a member ➜ <https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete/?id=s9njt1ey8b84d8567dayy5aora>

**Initial setup instructions**:

1. Navigate to System Console ➜ Integrations ➜ Integration Management ➜ [Enable Integrations on Postgres](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/admin_console/integrations/integration_management) (hint: open that link in a new tab and keep it open - you'll be glad you did)

2. Ensure that '**Enable integrations to override usernames:**' is set to true

3. Ensure that '**Enable integrations to override profile picture icons:**' is set to true

4. Go to Main Menu ➜ Integrations ➜ Incoming Webhook and click [Add Incoming Webhook](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/webhooks/integrations/incoming_webhooks/add)

5. Fill out the fields:

   - **Title**: (anything you'd like is fine)
   - **Description**: (also entirely up to you)
   - **Channel**: any channel other than Off-Topic (the payload will specify Off-Topic)
   - **Username**: (leave blank)
   - **Profile Picture**: (leave blank)

6. Select Save

7. Select Done

8. Copy the URL on the Setup Successful page (e.g., it will look something like https\://postgres.test.mattermost.com/hooks/9yg7sbhs73g6pjmd5figcaisuh)

9. Install the native (Mac, or Windows) Postman App: [https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/\\](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/%5C) **Note**: The [Chrome Postman app is deprecated](https://blog.postman.com/2017/11/01/goodbye-postman-chrome-app/) so you may not want to use it

10. Launch Postman and follow the steps below to set it up:

    1. Click the "New" button in the top left
    2. Select "Request" in the modal window that appears
    3. Give your request a name (e.g., "Incoming Mattermost Webhook test")
    4. Create or save it to an existing folder
    5. Click 'Get' just below the name of your request (near the top left corner)
    6. Select "POST" from the dropdown menu

    7. Paste the URL you copied in step 8 (the one above ⬆️ that starts with"_Copy the URL…_" not the one below 🤦) into the "Enter request URL" field just to the right of POST
    8. Click the "Body" tab, select "raw" radio button, and paste in the text from below this step
       \
       \
       {"channel": "off-topic", "username": "new\_username", "text": "The following escaped characters should be appear normally (ampersand, open angle, close angle): \&amp; \&lt; \&gt; \nThe following should appear as links: \<https\://about.mattermost.com/|This is a link to about-dot-mattermost-dot-com>! \[Markdown Link also to About page]\(https\://about.mattermost.com/) Normal Link: https\://about.mattermost.com/ Mail Link: \<mailto:mail\@example.com|Email> \nThe following should be markdown formatted (mouse emoji, strawberry emoji, then formatting as indicated): 🐹 :strawberry: \*\*bold\*\* \_italic\_ `code` \~\~strike\~\~ #hashtag \nThe following should turn into a mention if there is an account named test, and clicking it should open profile popover: @test ", "icon\_url": "http\://www\.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon\_WS.png"}
    9. Test it by clicking the "Send" button (you should see "ok" if it worked)

\
**Note**: Once you set this up you'll only need to change the payload text you pasted in step 8 above for different purposes.
