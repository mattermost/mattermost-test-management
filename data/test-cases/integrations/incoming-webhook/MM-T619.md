(**Story**) [Mobile web: Move bot indicator next to username â€” MM-13219](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13219)

**Expected**

- Webhook saved successfully in Mattermost, with no error message

- A post has been made by a webhook in Off Topic channel:

  - Posted by username "new\_username" (as defined in the payload)
  - Profile pic = Mattermost logo![](https://smartbear-tm4j-prod-us-west-2-attachment-rich-text.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1578947318269-1578947318268.png)image (as defined in the payload)
  - "BOT" label appears next to username
  - There should be no status indicator for the bot
  - Formatting appears as described in the post
  - If account is set to display link previews, preview of about.mattermost.com displays
  - Pop-Over matches profile image and user name supplied. And the pop-over shows a footer of \`this post was created by an integration from @\<user who made the webhook>
