## MM-T619: 🚀 Webhook with @-mention, username and profile pic, and basic formatting

---

**Step 1**

Incoming Webhooks — Webhook with @-mention, username and profile pic, and basic formatting\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Set up the webhook and Postman per the instructions outlined in [T2029](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin%3Acom.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T2029) above
   \
   (which should be the very first "test" at the top of this group of tests)
2. Click Send in Postman
3. Go back to Mattermost and view the "Off Topic" channel

(**Story**) [Mobile web: Move bot indicator next to username — MM-13219](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13219)

**Expected**

- Webhook saved successfully in Mattermost, with no error message

- A post has been made by a webhook in Off Topic channel:

  - Posted by username "new\_username" (as defined in the payload)
  - Profile pic = Mattermost logo![](https://smartbear-tm4j-prod-us-west-2-attachment-rich-text.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1578947318269-1578947318268.png)image (as defined in the payload)
  - "BOT" label appears next to username
  - There should be no status indicator for the bot
  - Formatting appears as described in the post
  - If account is set to display link previews, preview of about.mattermost.com displays
  - Pop-Over matches profile image and user name supplied. And the pop-over shows a footer of \`this post was created by an integration from @\<user who made the webhook>
