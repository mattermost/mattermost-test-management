## MM-T620: Payload username and profile picture override in-app settings

---

**Step 1**

Incoming Webhooks — Payload username and profile picture override in-app settings\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Edit [the incoming webhook you created In Mattermost](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/v16/integrations/incoming_webhooks):

   - **Username**: in-app
   - **Profile Picture**: https\://pbs.twimg.com/profile\_images/3303520670/4da3468b30495a5d73e6f31df068e5c9.jpeg
     \
     ![](https://smartbear-tm4j-prod-us-west-2-attachment-rich-text.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1589572953133-1589572953133.png)

2. Click 'Update'

3. In Postman, click `Send`

(**Story**) [Mobile web: Move bot indicator next to username — MM-13219](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13219)\
Yup. Same ticket as the test you just did above. You're not seeing things.

_Important notes about this step:_

**⚠️ Tip**: Keep the [Incoming Webhooks page](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/v16/integrations/incoming_webhooks) open in a separate tab as you'll need to edit the webhook several times again in the steps below

**Expected**

Posts successfully

- Username shows as what is in the payload in Postman (`new\_username`, same as before as it ignores the webhook settings and overrides them with the payload data)
- Profile picture shows as what is in the payload in Postman (Mattermost logo![](https://smartbear-tm4j-prod-us-west-2-attachment-rich-text.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1578947318269-1578947318268.png)image, same as before as it ignores the webhook settings and overrides them with the payload data)
- There should be no status indicator for the bot
- Clicking both the username and the profile image will show the profile popover
- BOT label is next to the user's name instead of below the profile image
- \- Formatted as described in post - Pop-Over matches profile image and user name supplied. And the pop-over shows a footer of \`this post was created by an integration from @\<user who made the webhook>
