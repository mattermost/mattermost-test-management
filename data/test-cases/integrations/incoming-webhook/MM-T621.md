## MM-T621: 🚀 Override username and profile picture (remove overrides from payload)

---

**Step 1**

Incoming Webhooks — Override username and profile picture (remove overrides from payload)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Edit the payload in Postman to remove username and profile icon (delete the following):

   - "username": "new\_username",
   - "icon\_url": "http\://www\.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon\_WS.png"\
     \
     **❇️ Shortcut**: Replace the existing payload data with the text in the "Test Data" field

2. In Postman, click `Send`

_Important notes about this step:_

**The answer to the question you're pondering doing right now**: This does so because the payload lacked the data _**and**_ the System Console settings allow the incoming webhook to define the username & profile picture.

**Test Data**

{"channel": "off-topic", "text": "The following escaped characters should be appear normally (ampersand, open angle, close angle): \&amp; \&lt; \&gt; \nThe following should appear as links: \<https\://about.mattermost.com/|This is a link to about-dot-mattermost-dot-com>! \[Markdown Link also to About page]\(https\://about.mattermost.com/) Normal Link: https\://about.mattermost.com/ Mail Link: \<mailto:mail\@example.com|Email> \nThe following should be markdown formatted (mouse emoji, strawberry emoji, then formatting as indicated): 🐹 :strawberry: \*\*bold\*\* \_italic\_ `code` \~\~strike\~\~ #hashtag \nThe following should turn into a mention if there is an account named test, and clicking it should open profile popover: @test "}

**Expected**

Posts successfully

- Username shows as what is specified in webhook in Mattermost (`in-app`)
- Profile picture shows as what is in the webhook in Mattermost (sloth![](https://cloudfront.tm4j.smartbear.com/tenant/ad722c15-e2a6-3788-82f3-92f99221f446/project/10302/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1578947476010-1578947476009.png))
