## MM-T622: Disallow override of username and profile picture

---

**Step 1**

Incoming Webhooks — Disallow override of username and profile picture\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Disallow override of username and profile pic in [the System Console](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/admin_console/integrations/integration_management) (set both to 'False') and save
2. Send from Postman again

**Tip**: If you have the settings page and the channel where you've been testing incoming webhooks in view at the same time you can see the changes take place without having to send from postman again.

[Wide images posted by webhook can be cut off in RHS — MM-13268](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13268)

_Important notes about this step:_

**Notes**:

- When applying this setting, previous posts created by the webhook are also flipped over to respect the current setting
- ⚠️ When done with this test set the overrides you changed back to 'True' before continuing

**Test Data**

**Expected**

**Posts with**:

- Username = the user who set up the webhook
- Profile picture = the user who set up the webhook
- Fields are not available in Incoming Webhooks UI when editing incoming webhook
