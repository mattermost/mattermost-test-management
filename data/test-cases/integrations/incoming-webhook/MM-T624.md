[RN: Viewing a message attachment with an invalid image URL causes the app to crash — MM-14669](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14669)

**Test Data**

{"channel": "off-topic", "username": "new\_username", "text": "The image below should be broken due to the invalid URL in the payload text you just sent using Postman \n", "attachments":\[{"image\_url":"https\://example.com"}], "icon\_url": "http\://www\.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon\_WS.png"}

**Expected**

- The post can be viewed in the client without causing other issues. (The mobile app does not crash)
- The image is broken as expected (invalid URL)
