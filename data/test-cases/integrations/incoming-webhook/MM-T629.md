## MM-T629: Incoming webhook with Slack attachment, mention in `pretext`

---

**Step 1**

Incoming webhook with Slack attachment, mention in `pretext`\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Set up an incoming webhook with any title, description (can leave username and pic blank)
2. Copy the incoming webhook URL
3. Go back to team, make sure you're NOT viewing the channel the webhook is going to post to
4. In Postman, set up a POST with Body ➜ Raw containing the attached payload
5. In the payload / body, replace USER\_ID with your test User ID in this format:
   \
   <@i57p7rc4stfg8gfwd71mhhrkoh>\
   (**Tip**: You can get your ID via [System Console ➜ Users](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/admin_console/user_management/users), ID is located below your username)
6. Send the POST

This is one more sentence to really make it a long field, and let's add a taco emoji :taco:."}, {"short": true, "title": "Iteration", "value": "Testing"}, {"short": true, "title": "State", "value": "New"}, {"short": false, "title": "Reason", "value": "New defect reported"}, {"short": false, "title": "Random field", "value": "This is a field which is not marked as short so it should be rendered on a separate row"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 1", "value": "Short field"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Field with link", "value": "\<http\://example.com|Link>"}], "mrkdwn\_in": \["pretext"], "pretext": "<@**USER\_ID**\*\*>\*\* Some text here to look at (verify eyes emoji) :eyes:", "text": "This is the text of the attachment. There should be a small Jenkins thumbnail off to the right.", "thumb\_url": "https\://slack.global.ssl.fastly.net/7bf4/img/services/jenkins-ci\_128.png", "title": "A slack attachment", "title\_link": "https\://www\.google.com"}]}

- Verify webhook posts, emoji render, pretext and attachment render, link renders
