## MM-T630: Incoming webhook with Slack attachment, mention in attachment `text`

---

**Step 1**

Incoming webhook with Slack attachment, mention in attachment `text`\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Set up an incoming webhook with any title, description (can leave username and pic blank)
2. Copy the incoming webhook URL
3. Go back to team, make sure you're NOT viewing the channel the webhook is going to post to
4. In Postman, set up a POST with Body > Raw containing the attached payload
5. In the payload / body, replace USER\_ID with your test User ID in this format:
   \
   <@i57p7rc4stfg8gfwd71mhhrkoh>\
   (**Tip**: You can get your ID via [System Console ➜ Users](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/admin_console/user_management/users), ID is located below your username)
6. Send the POST

**Test Data**

{"attachments": \[{"type": "slack\_attachment", "color": "#7CD197", "fields": \[{"short": false, "title": "Area", "value": "Testing with a very long piece of text that will take up the whole width of the table (stopping short of the space where the thumbnail image is displayed). This is one more sentence to really make it a long field, and let's add a taco emoji :taco:."}, {"short": true, "title": "Iteration", "value": "Testing"}, {"short": true, "title": "State", "value": "New"}, {"short": false, "title": "Reason", "value": "New defect reported"}, {"short": false, "title": "Random field", "value": "This is a field which is not marked as short so it should be rendered on a separate row"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 1", "value": "Short field"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 3", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 4", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 5", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 6", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Field with link", "value": "\<http\://example.com|Link>"}], "mrkdwn\_in": \["pretext"], "pretext": "Some text here to look at (verify eyes emoji) :eyes:", "text": "This is the text of the attachment. @USERNAME, there should be a small Jenkins thumbnail off to the right.", "thumb\_url": "https\://slack.global.ssl.fastly.net/7bf4/img/services/jenkins-ci\_128.png", "title": "A slack attachment", "title\_link": "https\://www\.google.com"}]}

**Expected**

- You get a mention, mention badge appears on channel in LHS, your username is highlighted in the attachment body of the webhook post
- (This part should be the same as above) Verify webhook posts, emoji render, pretext and attachment render, link renders
