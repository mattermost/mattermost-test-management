## MM-T631: Short field in payload can accept strings text in quotes for true and false

---

**Step 1**

Short field in payload can accept strings text in quotes for true and false\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In the payload / body, replace **USERNAME** with your test Username
2. Change the line "{"short": true, "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"}" to read "{"short": "false", "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"}" and send it
3. Switch the value back to true but leave it in quotes - {"short": "true", "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"} and send it again

**Test Data**

Payload for step 2:\
{"attachments": \[{"type": "slack\_attachment", "color": "#7CD197", "fields": \[{"short": false, "title": "Area", "value": "Testing with a very long piece of text that will take up the whole width of the table (stopping short of the space where the thumbnail image is displayed). This is one more sentence to really make it a long field, and let's add a taco emoji :taco:."}, {"short": true, "title": "Iteration", "value": "Testing"}, {"short": true, "title": "State", "value": "New"}, {"short": false, "title": "Reason", "value": "New defect reported"}, {"short": false, "title": "Random field", "value": "This is a field which is not marked as short so it should be rendered on a separate row"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 1", "value": "Short field"}, {"short": "false", "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Field with link", "value": "\<http\://example.com|Link>"}], "markdwn\_in": \["pretext"], "pretext": "Some text here to look at (verify eyes emoji) :eyes:", "text": "This is the text of the attachment. @**USERNAME**, there should be a small Jenkins thumbnail off to the right.", "thumb\_url": "https\://slack.global.ssl.fastly.net/7bf4/img/services/jenkins-ci\_128.png", "title": "A slack attachment", "title\_link": "https\://www\.google.com"}]}\
\
Payload for step 3 with "true" in quotes:\
{"attachments": \[{"type": "slack\_attachment", "color": "#7CD197", "fields": \[{"short": false, "title": "Area", "value": "Testing with a very long piece of text that will take up the whole width of the table (stopping short of the space where the thumbnail image is displayed). This is one more sentence to really make it a long field, and let's add a taco emoji :taco:."}, {"short": true, "title": "Iteration", "value": "Testing"}, {"short": true, "title": "State", "value": "New"}, {"short": false, "title": "Reason", "value": "New defect reported"}, {"short": false, "title": "Random field", "value": "This is a field which is not marked as short so it should be rendered on a separate row"}, {"short": true, "title": "Short 1", "value": "Short field"}, {"short": "true", "title": "Short 2", "value": "Another one"}, {"short": true, "title": "Field with link", "value": "\<http\://example.com|Link>"}], "mrkdwn\_in": \["pretext"], "pretext": "Some text here to look at (verify eyes emoji) :eyes:", "text": "This is the text of the attachment. @**USERNAME**, there should be a small Jenkins thumbnail off to the right.", "thumb\_url": "https\://slack.global.ssl.fastly.net/7bf4/img/services/jenkins-ci\_128.png", "title": "A slack attachment", "title\_link": "https\://www\.google.com"}]}

**Expected**

- **After step 1**: The text for "Short 2" and "Another one" has moved to a new line
- **After step 2**: The text for "Short 2" and "Another one" has returned to it's original location beside "Short 1"
