## MM-T639: 🚀 incoming Webhook creates DM

---

**Step 1**

Webhook creates DM\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. See above test to set up Postman (https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager\_\_main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T629)
2. Ensure that System Console ➜ Integrations ➜ Integration Management ➜ Enable integrations to override usernames is set to true
3. Identify a user you have NOT created a direct message channel with before (can create a new user in a different browser if that's easier)
4. In Postman, make sure "GET" has been changed to "POST" as described
5. In Postman, under `Body` select `raw` and paste in the text below, replacing `newuser` with the username you identified in step 2
6. In Postman, click `Send`

{"channel": "@newuser", "text": "This is a message to a newly created direct message channel"}\
\
⬆️ "newuser" is the user identified in step 2

**Expected**

- DM channel is opened with the newuser
- DM channel is marked as unread with mention
- Message posts "This is a message to a newly created direct message channel"
- Message is posted by username `webhook`, with the `BOT` label
