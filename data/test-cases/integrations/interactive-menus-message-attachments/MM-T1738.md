**Step 1**

Selected options with long usernames are not cut off in the RHS\

2. Select an option of a username that is quite long
3. Click on reply to the right of the original integration message posted

**Expected**

- Option is displayed in the text box
- Ephemeral message posts (only visible to you) showing the selection you have made
- RHS opens
- Username selected displays properly (truncated) and is not just cut off
