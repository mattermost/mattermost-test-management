**Step 1**

Change selection in RHS / RN Message Thread\
————————————————————————————\
Continuing from 5) in the above test\
1\. In the RHS / message thread, click in / tap on the message attachment menu box (or click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the message attachment menu box)\
2\. Select a different option to the one you selected in the center panel

**Expected**

After 2) the selection in the center panel changes to show the selection you made in the RHS and an ephemeral message is posted advising the selection you made (For RN, you will need to tap the back arrow to view the change in the channel view)
