## MM-T2035: 02 — Outgoing webhook - default username and overridden profile pic (using command) Trigger = posting a trigger word in any channel

---

**Step 1**

Outgoing webhook - default username and overridden profile pic (using command)\
Trigger = posting a trigger word in any channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**After setting up as above (in step 1)**:

1. Go back to Mattermost and edit the outgoing webhook:

   - Remove the channel you had selected
   - Add a trigger word
   - Paste "http\://via.placeholder.com/150/00F/888" in Profile Picture field
   - Save

2. Post the trigger word in any channel

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- After a user posts in the selected channel, observe the webhook message and verify that it has expected payload and override
- Response post appears in Mattermost as before, but this time it shows an image of a blue circle as seen in the test data column to the left
