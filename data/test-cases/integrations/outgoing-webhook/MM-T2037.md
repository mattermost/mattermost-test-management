---

**Step 1**

Outgoing Webhooks - overridden username and profile pic from webhook\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**After setting up as above (in step 1)**:\
Make sure override username and profile pic are enabled in System Console

1. Go back to Mattermost and edit the outgoing webhook:

   - Clear Username field
   - Clear Profile Picture field
   - Change callback URL to "https\://outgoing-webhook-01snptsk6qvz.runkit.sh?override\_username=user\_from\_webhook\&override\_icon\_url=http\://via.placeholder.com/150"
   - Save

2. Post the trigger word in any channel

3. Have another user post the trigger word in a different channel

**Expected**

- Webhook post appears in Mattermost with `user\_from\_webhook` as username and grey profile picture
