## MM-T2040: 07 — Disable overriding username and profile pic in System Console

---

**Step 1**

Disable overriding username and profile pic in System Console\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
With outgoing webhook set up as above, including username and profile pic (can keep using the one set up above):\\

1. System Console ➜ Integrations ➜ Integration Management
2. Set `Enable integrations to override usernames` to `false`
3. Set `Enable integrations to override profile picture icons` to `false`
4. Save
5. Back to the team, trigger the webhook

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- Webhook post appears in Mattermost with the username and profile picture of the user who created the webhook (that's how this server was set up). and BOT label (as seen in the test data column to the left):
