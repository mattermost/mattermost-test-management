## MM-T584: Outgoing webhook - default username and profile pic Trigger = posting anything in the specified channel

---

**Step 1**

Outgoing webhook - default username and profile pic\
Trigger = posting anything in the specified channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. In System console ➜ Integration ➜ Integration Management, set to true both "Enable integrations to override usernames and profile icons"

2. Copy "https\://outgoing-webhook-01snptsk6qvz.runkit.sh/" as callback URL or setup one if not available (see "<https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-qa-automation/tree/master/server/release_test_webhook>")

3. Set up outgoing webhook in Mattermost ➜ Integrations

   - Title / description anything you like, leave content type as-is
   - Select a channel from the drop-down
   - Leave trigger words blank
   - Paste the URL from step 2 in the Callback URLs field
   - Leave username and profile picture blank
   - Save

4. Post any message in the channel you selected

5. Have another user post in the channel you selected

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- After a user posts in the selected channel, observe the webhook message and verify that it has expected payload and override
- In the Mattermost channel, both users see a post like the following, where the username = webhook, and the profile pic is the webhook icon seen in the test data column to the left
