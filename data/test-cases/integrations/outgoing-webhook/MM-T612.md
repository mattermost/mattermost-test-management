---

**Step 1**

Outgoing Webhooks — Regenerate token\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Open Main Menu ➜ Integrations ➜ Outgoing Webhooks
2. Click "Regenerate Token" under the webhook you just created
3. Post the trigger word (or post in trigger channel) for the outgoing webhook

(**Story**) [Cypress: Search Date Filter tab — MM-15699](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15699)

**Expected**

After step 2, verify that the token changed.\
After step 3, webhook successfully triggers on use of keyword in the appropriate channel (in the case of this particular webhook, the response includes the updated token as well).
