## MM-T615: Only public channels available in outgoing webhooks setup

---

**Step 1**

Only public channels available in outgoing webhooks setup\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
Ensure there is at least one private channel on the team.

1. Open Main Menu > Integrations > Outgoing Webhooks
2. Click Add Outgoing Webhook (or Edit on an existing webhook)
3. Click the channel dropdown list

_Important notes about this step:_

**LM**: Should we add a step to verify no archived channels appear here?\
**SA** **08-Aug-2019**: I agree. Archived channel should not be included on the list.

**Expected**

- Only public channels (that you belong to) are listed in the channel dropdown. Private channels, archived channels and direct message channels are not shown for outgoing webhooks.
