- App creator should be able to edit their own app.

- System Admin should be able to edit anyone's app.

- No one other than system admin should be able to see other users' OAuth 2.0 apps.

  1. Edit the Zapier integration's description or name and save.

_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: Can create a fake OAuth app as a non-admin, then verified that system admin could edit it

**Expected**

- Verify changes saved
- Verify Zap still works
