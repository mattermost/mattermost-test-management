**Step 2**

1. Run "mmctl channel modify myteam:mychannel --private" to convert a public channel to a private channel

**Expected**

- You will see the converted channel move to UNREADS in Mattermost and a system message saying "this channel has been converted to a private channel" is posted in the channel

---

**Step 3**

1. Run "mmctl channel modify myteam:mychannel --public" to convert a private channel to a public channel

**Expected**

- You will see the converted channel move to PUBLIC CHANNELS in Mattermost and a system message saying "This channel has been converted to a Public Channel and can be joined by any team member." is posted in the channel
