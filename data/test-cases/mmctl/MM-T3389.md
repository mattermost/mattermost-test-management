---

**Step 1**

1\. Run a command to add a user to a channel using "mmctl channel add"\
2\. Run a command to remove a user from a channel using "mmctl channel remove"\
3\. Run "mmctl channel users --help"\
4\. Run a command to add a user to a channel using "mmctl channel users add"\
5\. Run a command to remove a user from a channel using "mmctl channel users remove"\
6\. Run "mmctl channel --help"

**Expected**

After 1 and 2, the commands should work but mmctl should print a message indicating that they are deprecated\
After 3, a help screen showing information about the channel users sub-commands should be shown\
After 4 and 5, both commands should work exactly like the ones in 1 and 2, but without the deprecation message\
After 6, in the help, the "add" and "remove" commands should not be shown as they are marked as deprecated, but a "users" sub-command should appear
