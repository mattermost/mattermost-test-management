## MM-T3874: Channel - Move : Private --force (with permissions, users in channel are NOT members of both teams)

---

**Step 1**

Members of current team are not members of destination team but use --force command\
\
mmctl channel move \[destination team] \[current team:private channel name] --force

**Expected**

the command should work, removing the users that are not in the destination team from the resulting channel
