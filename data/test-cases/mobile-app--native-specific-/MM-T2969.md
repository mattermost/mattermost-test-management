## MM-T2969: RN When System Admin Users and Teams ShowFullName is set to False DM should not display name of the sender

---

**Step 1**

1. Make sure you have a teammate with their full name present in their profile.
2. Make sure that "ShowFullName" in config.json is set to false.
3. Make sure your own display preferences for Teammate Name Display are set to Show first and last name.
4. Have them send you a DM.

[Push notifications ignore the "ShowFullName" setting — MM-18126](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18126)

**Expected**

- Verify you can't see their full first and last name in the push notification because the server settings prohibit that.
- Push notifications should respect the "ShowFullName" config.json setting and prioritize it over the display settings of any regular user (admins are not really a concern).
