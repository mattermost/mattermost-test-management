## MM-T3186: RN apps: Change channel

---

**Step 1**

Should display filtered channels list and be able to change channels\
————————————————————————————

1. Open channel drawer

2. Type the beginning of a channel name in the `Jump to...` search box

3. Verify relevant results are displayed in these categories, in this order (when filtered):

   - Unreads
   - Direct messages
   - Channels (public and private together, listed alphabetically. Favorites are listed together here too; not sorted separately)
   - Members (other users you don't already have a DM with)
   - Not a Member (public channels you don't belong to)

4. Tap on the name of a channel from the filtered list

**Expected**

- The channel you have tapped on opens.
