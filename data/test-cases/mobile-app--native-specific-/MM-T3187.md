## MM-T3187: RN apps: Unread channels sort at top

---

**Step 1**

Unread channels sort at top\
————————————————————————————\
(Unreads is always enabled on RN apps)

1. Open channel drawer (with at least one unread channel)
2. Verify unread channel(s) display at top of channel list (with mentions first, if any), in post date descending order, with title "Unreads"
3. Tap an unread channel to view it
4. Open channel drawer again

**Expected**

- Channel you just read is no longer listed in Unreads
