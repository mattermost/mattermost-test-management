## MM-T3195: RN apps: Unmute a channel

---

**Step 1**

Unmute a channel\
————————————————————————————

1. Mute a channel (as described in test above)
2. Return to the channel view to check that it has been muted
3. Tap on the channel name to display channel info
4. Tap on the button to the right of "Mute Channel" in channel info
5. Return to channel view to check that it has been unmuted

**Expected**

- Mute icon no longer appears next to channel name at top of channel
- Push notifications are received for that channel (manual verification, cannot be verified in detox)
