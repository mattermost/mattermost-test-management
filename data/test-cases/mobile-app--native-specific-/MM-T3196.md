## MM-T3196: RN apps: Add members to channel

---

**Step 1**

Add members to channel\
————————————————————————————

1. Tap a channel title to view channel info, and note the number of channel members next to Manage Members
2. Tap on "Add members", observe list of users on the server
3. Tap on "Search", observe keyboard opens
4. Type in the name of the user to be added, observe user list filters accordingly
5. Tap on the circle to the left of the user's name (first tap may just close keyboard; may have to tap again), observe the circle next to their name appears selected
6. Tap on "add" at the top right of the screen

**Expected**

- The user is added to the channel
- Total number of members next to "manage members" menu option should increase by the number of users added to the channel
- System message should display in the channel showing which members were added to the channel.
- Tapping on the user's name in the system message should open the user's profile from where you can send them a DM
