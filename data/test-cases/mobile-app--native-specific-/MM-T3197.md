## MM-T3197: RN apps: Load users in long Add Members list (channel)

---

**Step 1**

Load users in long Add Members list (channel)\
————————————————————————————\
On a server with enough users to fill several pages of scrolling (such as community-release.mattermost.com):

1. Tap "Add Members" on a channel info screen
2. Swipe up repeatedly (10+ times) to load more users in list

**Expected**

- Users should continue to load, without skipping any (should be obvious if it's skipping big chunks of users; also can compare to Add Members list on browser)
