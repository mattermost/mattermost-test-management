## MM-T3205: RN apps: Remove user from private channel

---

**Step 1**

Remove user from private channel\
————————————————————————————\
Ideally, use two devices and watch on the removed user's app / browser as they're removed from the channel to verify they are redirected to Town Square

1. Tap the name of a private channel
2. Tap `Manage Members`
3. Type the beginning of a user's name in the search box
4. Select user and tap `Remove`

**Expected**

- User is removed from channel:
- Member count decrements by one
- System message posts in channel for the user who removed them
- If watching as the removed user, that user sees Town Square, and the channel is removed from their channel drawer list
- User that was removed now also sees a message in a modal (from desktop) advising them they have been removed (if viewing channel while removed).
