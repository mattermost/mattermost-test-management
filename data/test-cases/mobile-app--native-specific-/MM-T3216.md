## MM-T3216: RN apps: Open DM with self

---

**Step 1**

Open DM with self\
————————————————————————————

1. In channel list drawer, tap `+` next to Direct Messages
2. Type your username to find in user list (will say "you" next to it)
3. Tap to select your own user

**Expected**

- The user list closes (can't have your own user in a GM, just a DM)
- DM displays, with your name at the top
- LHS shows it in DM list, with your name and "(you)"
