## MM-T3217: RN apps: Post a long message

---

**Step 1**

Post a long message\
————————————————————————————

1. In any channel, type a multi-line message (can copy a phrase and paste it repeatedly)
2. At the end of the message, type a bunch of characters as quickly as you can, then tap on the "aeroplane" icon

**Expected**

- The text box should expand to multiple lines as the message is typed. There should be no lag between pushing the send button and the message posting.
- After adding a few lines, the input box will stop expanding and text will scroll
