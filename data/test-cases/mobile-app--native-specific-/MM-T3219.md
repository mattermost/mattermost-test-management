1. Long press on a message in a channel (not a reply)
2. Tap on **Save**
3. Observe **save** icon appears on post
4. Tap three-dot menu, then tap **Saved Messages**
5. Tap a post in the **Saved Messages** list to open permalink view
6. Tap the `x` to return to **Saved Messages** view
7. Tap the `x` to return to channel view

**Expected**
