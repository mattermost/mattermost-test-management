## MM-T3222: RN apps: View Recent Mentions

---

**Step 1**

View Recent Mentions\
————————————————————————————

1. Have another user mention you (if you don't already have mentions)
2. Tap 3-dot menu, then tap `Recent Mentions`
3. Long-press a post in the list

**Expected**

- All recent mentions on that team or in DM/GMs are listed
- There is no option to Add a Reaction from that view
