---

**Step 1**

Emoji reaction in center channel:\
\- Add using long press\
\- Add using `+`\
————————————————————————————\
**In center channel**:

1. Long press on a message and select Add Reaction
2. Type a couple characters in the search bar and select an emoji
3. Verify added
4. In message box, type `+:` and a couple characters
5. Tap to select an emoji from the autocomplete list

**Expected**

- Reaction is added to message in each case (when added by typing, the reaction is added to the most recent "real" (not ephemeral or system) message in the channel)
