## MM-T3226: RN apps: iOS ONLY - Emoji autocomplete vs. autocorrect

---

**Step 1**

Emoji autocomplete vs. autocorrect - iOS\
————————————————————————————\
**N/A for Android**\
\\

1. On iOS RN app, type a colon `:` followed by two letters such as `:pr`
2. You want to find two letters cause you need to see 1) emoji autocomplete option(s) in Mattermost and also 2) iOS keyboard autocorrect suggestion, highlighted
3. Find a combo where the emoji name and the highlighted autocorrect suggestion do not match
4. Tap one of the emoji suggestions

**Example that worked for me for a while until iOS learned it**:

1. Type `:pr`
2. Emoji autocomplete list appears, with `:pray:` at the top
3. iOS keyboard autocorrect showed `or` , highlighted, to indicate it would insert it as I typed
4. Tap the `:pray:` emoji

In this example, before the bug was fixed, the message box said `:or ay:`

[iOS autocorrect overwriting Mattermost autocomplete — MM-12952](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-12952)

**Expected**

- Message box shows the emoji name without any character replacements `:pray:` , and tapping the icon to post shows the selected emoji\
  **Note**: The original bug inserted iOS's autocorrect suggestion on tapping in the emoji list, instead of the Mm emoji autocomplete, such as `:or ay:` in the message box\
  **Note**: Also affected \~ channel autocomplete and / slash command autocomplete
