## MM-T3239: RN apps: Long list of search results

---

**Step 1**

Long list of search results\
————————————————————————————

1. Perform a search that will have many results (such as `test`; may need to test on a server with history, such as community.mattermost.com)
2. Scroll search results down through several pages' worth

**Expected**

- Additional batches of results continue to load automatically (infinite scroll), no crashes
- Occasionally stop scrolling and check a date; should be getting older posts as you continue to scroll
- Note: Server limit is 100 results displayed, so if >100 results, the list will stop loading at 100
