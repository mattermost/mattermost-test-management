## MM-T3244: RN apps: Preview different file types

---

**Step 1**

Preview different file types\
————————————————————————————

1. Have a user in a browser post a couple images, a video or two, and some documents (see below for file types to test on each platform)
2. View the posts from the RN app
3. Tap on each file to preview (may have to tap to download)

**Video**\
**iOS**: mp4 and mov\
**Android (needs viewer installed)**: mp4, mkv, webm, 3gp\
\
**Documents (for both iOS and Android)**:\
PDF, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, rtf

**Expected**

- Previews should open full-screen on your device.
- Can rotate device to view in landscape mode.
- Swipe up closes the preview for image files; tapping Done closes the preview for other file types
