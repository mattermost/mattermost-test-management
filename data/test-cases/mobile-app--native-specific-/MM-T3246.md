## MM-T3246: RN apps: File preview - Delete file cache

---

**Step 1**

File preview - Delete file cache\
————————————————————————————

1. Ensure you have downloaded a file such as a video or document in order to preview it
2. Verify that if you tap the file to preview, it does not download it again; it just shows the preview
3. Go to right-hand three-dot menu ➜ Settings ➜ Advanced Settings

**Expected**

- Cache amount should show approx 58KB (after app restarts you're returned to Town Square so loading the channel adds a few KB)

---

**Step 2**

1. Tap Delete Documents & Data, tap Delete to confirm verify file cache displays as `0 B`
2. Go back to the file you had downloaded and previewed, and tap to preview it again

**Expected**

- It should download the file (or ask to) again before displaying the preview
