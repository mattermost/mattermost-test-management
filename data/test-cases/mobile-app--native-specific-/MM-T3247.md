**Step 1**

Should allow user to **swipe through** and **share** from a multiple attachment gallery\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Login to server and go to a channel
2. Post 5 files of different types at the same time (document, video, image, etc)
3. Tap on multiple attachment gallery post
4. Attempt to **swipe through** and **share**

**Expected**

After #4,

- Verify user is able to swipe left/right through the attachments

- Verify appropriate preview is displayed for each file

  - Image and video - preview rendered
  - Document - **Open file** button
  - Unsupported - **Download file** button

- Verify `header file count` (e.g. 1 of 5) is displayed and updated for each preview

- Verify **share button** is available for each preview
