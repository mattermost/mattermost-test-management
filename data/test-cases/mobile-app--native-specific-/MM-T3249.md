---

**Step 1**

Should be able to switch between teams\
\--------------------\
1\. Login to server where you belong to more than one team\
2\. Open main sidebar, tap on **switch teams button** (or swipe right)\
3\. Tap on **first team**\
4\. Repeat step 2 and tap on **second team** (different from current team)\
5\. Repeat step 2

**Expected**

After #1,

- Verify **first team channel** is displayed

After #2,

- Verify **team sidebar** is opened
- Verify first team is current (checked)

After #3,

- Verify team sidebar is dismissed and \*\*first team channel \*\*is displayed

After #4,

- Verify team sidebar is dismissed and \*\*second team channel \*\*is displayed

After #5,

- Verify first team is **not** current (not checked)
- Verify second team **is** current (checked)

Note: Direct / Group message list should be the same across teams on the same server.

- A separate test case will be created for the verifying DMs and GMs across teams to include more detailed steps for automation
