## MM-T3255: RN apps: Notifications - Mention badges

---

**Step 1**

Should display mention badges after an at-mention\
————————————————————————————

1. Have another user mention you in a channel you are not currently viewing
2. Do not tap the notification to view the post
3. Observe app icon, channel drawer, team button in channel drawer, and team sidebar

**Expected**

On some Android devices / configurations, mention badge appears on app icon.\
**Also**: If configured for numbered badge, app icon badge count only counts mentions, it does not count unread posts(non-mentions) and it should match the sidebar hamburger menu count.\
\
On all devices, mention badge appears:

- on channel in channel drawer
- on team button in channel drawer (when viewing a different team)
- on team sidebar

**Note**: Mention badge will NOT appear on team button in channel drawer if the mention you received is within the same team you are currently viewing (or if it is a DM, which is technically on no team). To see the mention on the team button in the channel drawer, switch teams - it will then be visible.\
\
App icon badge can only be verified manually.
