## MM-T3267: RN apps: Share extension tests (Further share extension tests added in main Release Testing spreadsheet, Files/Attachments tab)

---

**Step 1**

Share extension tests\
(Further share extension tests added in main Release Testing spreadsheet, Files/Attachments tab)\
————————————————————————————\
DH: Here are some cases based on previous issues found:

- Always include text in your post along with the file
- Share an image other than screenshot
- Share a screenshot
- Share a video file (such as mp4)
- Share a file while the Mattermost app is not running in the background
- Share a file while the Mattermost app is already running in background
- Share a file from the file manager (instead of the camera app)
- Make a post with 5 image attachments (be careful to keep under 50 MB if testing on community server)
- DM Channel display on share matches RHS channel list
