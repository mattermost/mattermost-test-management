## MM-T3274: RN apps: Log in user who is on no teams

---

**Step 1**

Log in user who is on no teams\
————————————————————————————

1. Using a browser, either:

   - Create a new account on an open server (such as rc.test) and join no teams (the server should have open teams available)\
     OR
   - Log in as a user and leave all teams (the server should have open teams available)

2. Open RN app (either iOS or Android) and go to that server URL

3. Enter the user's login info and tap to complete login

**Expected**

- Team selection page displays
- Can join team (assuming there is an open team available on that server)
