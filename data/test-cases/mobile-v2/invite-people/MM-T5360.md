## MM-T5360: Mobile V2: Invite - Copy and share invite link

**Objective**

- Verify the functionality of the invite mechanism/workflow in the Mobile V2 app.
- The purpose of this specific test is to allow a way to copy and share a link to sign up to the server.
- Note: For more information about this feature refer to the links in the Traceability tab for this test case in Zephyr Scale.

**Precondition**

1. The server is set to allow account creation in System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup
2. Permissions are set to allow users to invite team members in System Console ➜ User Management ➜ PermissionsNote: Permissions can be set for different user levels but for the purposes of these tests set it to allow all users to invite members.

**Step 1**

1. Log in as a regular user on a server that allows inviting members

2. Tapping the + sign in the top right corner of the mobile app opens a menu at the bottom of the screen\

3. Tapping 'Invite people to the team' in the menu opens the Invite form that fills the screen

   - The system keyboard is at the bottom of the screen with the focus to start typing in a field that asks you to "Type a name or email address…"
   - The X in the top left dismisses the screen and returns you to the server channel you were on

4. Tap the 'Share link' button in the top right corner which dismisses the screen and opens the share sheet at the bottom of the screen\
