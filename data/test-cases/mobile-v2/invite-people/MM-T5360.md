## MM-T5360: Should open the invite screen

---

**Objective**

Verify the functionality of the invite mechanism/workflow in the Mobile V2 app.
Note: For more information refer to the links in the Traceability tab above.

**Precondition**

1. The server is set to allow account creation in System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup
2. Permissions are set to allow users to invite team members in System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permissions
Note: Permissions can be set for different user levels but for the purposes of these tests set it to allow all users to invite members.

**Step 1**

1. Log in as a regular user on a server that allows inviting members
2. Tapping the + sign in the top right corner of the mobile app opens the invite menu at the bottom of the screen
3. Tapping 'Invite people to the team' in the menu opens a form that fills the screen
    • The system keyboard is at the bottom of the screen with the focus to start typing in a field that asks you to "Type a name or email address…"
    • The X in the top left dismisses the screen and returns you to the server channel you were on
    • Tapping the 'Share link' button in the top right corner dismisses the screen and opens up the system sharing options at the bottom of the screen

**Expected**

    • Invite screen opens as described in step 3
