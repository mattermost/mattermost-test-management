## MM-T5361: Should show no results item in search list

---

**Objective**

- Verify the functionality of the invite mechanism/workflow in the Mobile V2 app.
- Specifically for this test we need to ensure that no results will appear in the search list under certain conditions.
- Note: For more information about this feature refer to the links in the Traceability tab for this test case in Zephyr Scale.

**Precondition**

1. The server is set to allow account creation in System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup
2. Permissions are set to allow users to invite team members in System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permissions
    - Note: Permissions can be set for different user levels but for the purposes of these tests set it to allow all users to invite members.

**Step 1**

1. Log in as a regular user on a server that allows inviting members
2. Tap the + sign in the top right corner of the mobile app to open the a menu at the bottom of the screen

3. Tap 'Invite people to the team' in the menu to open the Invite form that fills the screen
4. Type in a string of characters that you know won't match any user on the server into the field that asks you to "Type a name or email address…"
    

**Expected**

- A box appears below the field you're typing in that reads "No one found matching [what you typed]"
