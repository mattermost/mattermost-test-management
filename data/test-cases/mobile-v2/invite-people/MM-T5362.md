## MM-T5362: Should be able to send email invite

---

**Objective**

- Verify the functionality of the invite mechanism/workflow in the Mobile V2 app.
- Specifically for this test we need to ensure that users are able to send email invitations.
- **Note**: For more information about this feature refer to the links in the Traceability tab for this test case in Zephyr Scale.

**Precondition**

1. The server is set to allow account creation in System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup
2. Permissions are set to allow users to invite team members in System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permissions
    - Note: Permissions can be set for different user levels but for the purposes of these tests set it to allow all users to invite members.

**Step 1**

1. Log in as a regular user on a server that allows inviting members
2. Tap the + sign in the top right corner of the mobile app to open the Plus menu at the bottom of the screen

3. Tap 'Invite people to the team' in the menu to open the Invite form that fills the screen
4. Type in a string of characters that you know won't match any user on the server into the field that asks you to "Type a name or email address…"
    

**Expected**

- A box appears below the field you're typing in that reads "No one found matching [what you typed]"
