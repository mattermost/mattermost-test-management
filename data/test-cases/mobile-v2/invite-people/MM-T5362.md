## MM-T5362: Should be able to send email invite

---

**Objective**

Verify the functionality of the invite mechanism/workflow in the Mobile V2 app.
Specifically for this test we need to ensure that we're able to send email invites.
Note: For more information about this feature refer to the links in the Traceability tab above.

**Precondition**

1. The server is set to allow account creation in System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup
2. Permissions are set to allow users to invite team members in System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permissions
Note: Permissions can be set for different user levels but for the purposes of these tests set it to allow all users to invite members.
**Step 1**

1. Log in as a regular user on a server that allows inviting members
2. Tap the + sign in the top right corner of the mobile app to open the invite menu at the bottom of the screen
3. Tap 'Invite people to the team' in the menu to open the Invite form that fills the screen
4. Type in an email address that you have access to into the field that asks you to "Type a name or email address…"

**Expected**
