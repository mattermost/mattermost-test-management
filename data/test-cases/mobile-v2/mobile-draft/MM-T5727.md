## MM-T5727: User should be able to view scheduled message

---

**Step 1**

Positive Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ensure the "Drafts" page displays all scheduled messages.

- Verify the scheduled messages displayed are from the current team.
- Verify changing teams will display scheduled messages from that team's Channel/DM/GM.

---

**Step 2**

### Scenario 2: Validate scheduled messages are sorted chronologically.

---

**Step 3**

### Scenario 3: Confirm the "Scheduled" tab shows only scheduled messages, excluding unsent drafts.

---

**Step 4**

### Scenario 4: Verify long-press on a scheduled message opens the edit view.

Negative Scenarios

---

**Step 5**

### Scenario 5: Check the behavior when there are no scheduled messages (empty state UI).

---

**Step 6**

### Scenario 6: Simulate a scenario where the scheduled message data fails to load (e.g., API failure).
