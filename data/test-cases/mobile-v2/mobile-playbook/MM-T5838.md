## MM-T5838: [E2E] View Active Runs on Mobile

---

**Step 1**

1. Login to a Mattermost server on a mobile device
2. Navigate to the Playbooks screen
3. Tap on the "Runs" tab
4. User should see List of active Playbook runs.

**Expected**

- The screen switches to show active playbook runs
- Active runs are displayed in a list format
- Each run shows relevant information (name, status, etc.)
- If no active runs exist, an appropriate empty state message is shown

---

**Step 2**

Observe the UI elements and information displayed for active runs

**Expected**

- Each run item shows:

  - Run name
  - Status indicators (in progress, overdue, etc.)
  - Timestamp information (created, last updated)
  - Owner/participant information

- The list is organized in a logical manner (e.g., by recency or status)

- Any filtering or sorting options are functional

---

**Step 3**

1. Pull down to refresh the list of runs
2. Tap on one of the active runs

**Expected**

- The refresh action works correctly and updates the list
- Tapping on a run navigates to the run details screen
- The run details screen shows comprehensive information about the selected run

---

**Step 4**

1. Test offline behavior by enabling airplane mode
2. Test with a large number of runs to verify performance

**Expected**

- In offline mode, previously loaded runs are still visible with appropriate offline indicators
- Performance remains good even with many runs in the list
- Scrolling and navigation remain smooth
