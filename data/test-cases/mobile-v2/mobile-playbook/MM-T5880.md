**Step 1**

Tap on a task to open the task details.

**Step 2**

Try to dismiss the bottom sheet by swiping down.

**Expected**

The bottom sheet can be dismissed by swiping down and closes properly.

**Step 3**

Examine the spacing and alignment of action buttons (Check, Skip, Run Command).

**Expected**

Action buttons have correct spacing, alignment, and are easily tappable with proper visual hierarchy.

---

**Step 4**

Open a task with a long description that exceeds the visible area.

**Expected**

Long task descriptions are scrollable within the bottom sheet without affecting the overall layout.

---

**Step 5**

Enable VoiceOver/Screen Reader and navigate through the task details.

VoiceOver/Screen Reader properly reads all task details including actions, assignee, due date, and command information with appropriate accessibility labels.
