## MM-T5881: Task Bottom Sheet - Edge Cases and Error Handling Scenarios

---

**Step 1**

Disconnect from network and attempt to update assignee or due date fields.

**Expected**

Updates fail gracefully with appropriate error messages and don't crash the app.

---

**Step 2**

Assign a task to a user, then have that user deleted from the system.

**Expected**

The task shows a fallback state (like "Unknown User" or similar) instead of crashing.

---

**Step 3**

Configure a task with an invalid or non-existent slash command and attempt to run it.

**Expected**

Running the invalid command shows appropriate error message and doesn't crash the app.

---

**Step 4**

Test the bottom sheet behavior on different screen sizes (small phones vs tablets).

**Expected**

The bottom sheet adapts properly to different screen sizes and maintains usability across devices.

---

**Step 5**

Modify task state (check/assign), navigate away from the task, then return to the same task.

**Expected**

All task states (checked status, assignments, due dates) persist correctly after navigation.
