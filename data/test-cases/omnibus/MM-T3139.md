## MM-T3139: Bad domain name and dpkg-reconfigure

---

**Step 1**

Bad domain name and dpkg-reconfigure\
————————————————————————————\
In a new server:

1. Run "curl -o- <https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/repo-setup.sh> | sudo bash"
2. Run "apt install mattermost-omnibus" and follow the steps. In the domain name prompt, introduce a bad domain name, one that doesn't correspond with the test server

**Expected**

- The package install should show an error related to the SSL certificate and a help dialog asking the user to run dpkg-reconfigure. The package installation should finish correctly from the Debian perspective

---

**Step 2**

1. Run "dpkg -l | grep mattermost-omnibus"

**Expected**

- The mattermost omnibus should be correctly installed (the line should start with "ii")

---

**Step 3**

1. Go to the server URL

**Expected**

- The URL should not be accessible

---

**Step 4**

1. Run "dpkg-reconfigure mattermost-omnibus". Fix the domain name to be the right one

**Expected**

- The dpkg-reconfigure command should have run mmomni reconfigure command successfully

---

**Step 5**

1. Go to the server URL

**Expected**

- The URL should be correctly accessible under the right domain name, with the certificate successfully retrieved and configured
