## MM-T2433: Plugins Management - Username autocomplete

---

**Step 1**

Plugins Management - Username autocomplete\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. View a team (or create a new team), and identify a user on the server who is not on that team
2. From there, go to System Console ➜ Plugins ➜ JIRA
3. In username field, start to type the name of a user who is not on the team you were viewing in step 1

**Expected**

- Autocomplete finds the user (should find any user on the system, regardless of team membership)
