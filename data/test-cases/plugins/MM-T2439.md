## MM-T2439: Zoom icon and surrounding elements display as expected in mobile/tablet view

---

**Step 1**

Zoom icon and surrounding elements display as expected in mobile/tablet view\
————————————————————————————\
On server with Zoom enabled (or fill in fake Zoom settings on test server and enable the plugin):

1. Narrow your window until your view is switched to mobile view
2. Verify icons in top nav look normal (when it was broken, Zoom icon was replaced with a dot and hidden text and other icons shifted position unexpectedly)
3. Click the dropdown next to channel name to open channel menu

_Related ticket(s):_

[Channel dropdown menu UI is broken in mobile view when Zoom plugin enabled — MM-15652](http://mmthttps%3A//mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15652)

**Expected**

- Channel menu formatting looks normal, and the Zoom item is text that says "Start Zoom Meeting" (as opposed to the Zoom icon displaying and messing up the list formatting)
