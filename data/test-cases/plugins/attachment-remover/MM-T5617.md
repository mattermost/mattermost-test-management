## MM-T5617: Installation and uninstallation of the Attachments Remover Plugin

---

**Step 1**

Install Across Different Server Setups

1. Obtain the plugin by either downloading it from the [repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-attachments-remover) or by building it from source.
2. Upload the plugin to the Mattermost server.
3. Perform sanity check

**Expected**

The plugin should install and uninstall without any issues across different server setups, including:

- Server Editions: Free and Enterprise
- Licensing: With or without a license
- Hosting: Self-hosted only, Cloud does not allow plugin upload
- Deployment: Single-server or High-Availability setup

The plugin should perform its intended functionality (removing attachments) correctly without errors or unexpected behavior.

---

**Step 2**

Install Plugin on Supported and Unsupported Server Versions

1. Attempt to install the plugin on both supported and unsupported Mattermost server versions.

**Expected**

The plugin should install successfully only on supported versions. The minimum supported server version is `6.2.1`.
