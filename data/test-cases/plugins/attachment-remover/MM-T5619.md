**Step 1**

1. Post two messages: one with a single attachment and another with multiple attachments.
2. Ensure the "Remove attachments" option is available in the menu.
3. Select "Remove Attachments" for each post.

**Expected**

The "Remove attachments" option is available for both posts. Upon selection, the attachments are removed, and the post is marked as `Edited`.
