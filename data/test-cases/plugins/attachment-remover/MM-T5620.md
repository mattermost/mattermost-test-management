## MM-T5620: Permission-Based Attachment Removal

---

**Step 1**

1. Post two messages with attachments: one where the user has permission to `Edit Own Posts` (configured in `System Console > Permission`), and one without that permission.
2. Check if the "Remove attachments" option is available for each post.
3. If available, remove the attachment from the post.

**Expected**

- The "Remove attachments" option should only be available for posts where the user has permission to edit.
- If the user has permission, the attachment is removed, and the post is marked as `Edited`.
- If the user lacks permission, the option to remove the attachment should not be available.

**Step 2**

1. Post two messages with attachments: one where the user has permission to `Edit Others' Posts` (configured in `System Console > Permission`), and one without that permission.
2. Verify if the "Remove attachments" option is available for each post.
3. If available, remove the attachment from the post.

**Expected**

- The "Remove attachments" option should only be available for posts where the user has permission to edit.
- If the user has permission, the attachment is removed, and the post is marked as `Edited`.
- If the user lacks permission, the option to remove the attachment should not be available.
