## MM-T5620: Permission-Based Attachment Removal

---

**Step 1**

1. Post two messages with attachments: one where the user has permission to edit others' posts, and one without that permission.
2. Check if the "Remove attachments" option is available.
3. Attempt to remove attachments for both posts.

**Expected**

- The "Remove attachments" option is available for both posts.
- If the user has permission, the attachment is removed, and the post is marked as `Edited`.
- If the user lacks permission, the attachment is not removed, and a system message displays `Can't remove attachments: Not authorized`.
