## MM-T5621: Attachment Removal with Time Limit

---

**Step 1**

1. Enable `Edit Own Posts` in `System Console > Permission` and set the `Edit Post Time Limit` (e.g., `60` seconds).
2. Post a message with an attachment and remove it within the time limit.
3. Post another message with an attachment, then check if the "Remove attachments" option is still available after the time limit has passed.

**Expected**

- The "Remove attachments" option should only be available within the edit time limit.
- Removing within the time limit successfully removes the attachment, and the post is marked as `Edited`.
- Once the edit time limit has passed, the option to remove the attachment should no longer be available.
