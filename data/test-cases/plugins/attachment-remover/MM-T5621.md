## MM-T5621: Attachment Removal with Time Limit

---

**Step 1**

1. Set a post edit time limit (e.g., `60` seconds).
2. Post a message with an attachment and remove it within the time limit.
3. Post another message with an attachment and attempt to remove it after the time limit.

**Expected**

- The "Remove attachments" option is available for both posts.
- Removing within the time limit successfully removes the attachment, and the post is marked as `Edited`.
- Attempting removal after the time limit fails, with a system message: `Can't remove attachments: Post is too old to edit`.
