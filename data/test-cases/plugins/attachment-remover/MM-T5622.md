---

**Step 1**

1. Post a message that has only an attachment (no text), then remove the attachment.
2. Post a root message with only an attachment (no text), reply to this root post, and then remove the attachment from the root post.
3. Post a root message with text, reply to it with only an attachment (no text), and then remove the attachment from the reply.

**Expected**

- The post that originally contained only an attachment is successfully cleared (attachment removed), marked as `Edited`, and displayed as a blank post, without being deleted.
