## MM-T5624: Remove Attachments via Slash Command

---

**Step 1**

1. Post a message with an attachment, retrieve its post ID, and post a slash command `/removeattachments <post_id>`.

**Expected**

- No autocompletion is available when typing `/removeattachments`.
- A dialog appears with the header `Remove Attachments` and the message `Are you sure you want to remove all attachments from this post?`, along with `Cancel` and `Remove` buttons.
- Selecting `Cancel` keeps the attachment intact.
- Selecting `Remove` successfully removes the attachment if all conditions for removal are met. If not, a system message is posted in the channel indicating the reason.
