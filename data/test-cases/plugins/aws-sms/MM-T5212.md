2\. Create alarm for EC2 Per-Instance Metrics --> CPU Utilization\
3\. Create an alarm that will trigger when CPU utilization is greater than 0.01% for over 1 minute\
4\. Set the Topic to the test topic used in the creation test to ensure the alarm will trigger to a topic with a valid subscription to a Mattermost channel\
5\. Save the alarm\
6\. Wait 1 minute and open the channel where the subscription was confirmed
