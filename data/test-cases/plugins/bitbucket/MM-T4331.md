---

**Step 1**

1\. With another bitbucket account, @-mention the bitbucket user you connected previously in a bitbucket issue.\
2\. Then assign the bitbucket issue to them.\
3\. Finally request a review from them in a bitbucket PR.

**Expected**

User receives a DM from the bitbucket bot for each of the three actions (issue mentions, issue assignment, and PR review request)\
Verify BOT tag doesn't have a double box surrounding it.
