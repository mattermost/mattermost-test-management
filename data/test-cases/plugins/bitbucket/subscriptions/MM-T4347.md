## MM-T4347: Use Mattermost username instead of bitbucket handle if BitBucket user is mapped to a Mattermost user on the server

---

**Step 1**

1\. Set Up a bitbucket subscription on channel\
2\. Login as a target user and connect to a bitbucket account\
3\. From the bitbucket account connected in step 2. - Perform any acrions that will post an event with the current subscription

**Expected**

User's Mattermost username is show instead of their bitbucket handle\
For example: The delete branch event will post "@dkh-member just deleted branch \[DHaussermann/hello-world:ping]" instead of "DylanH20 just deleted branch \[DHaussermann/hello-world:ping]"
