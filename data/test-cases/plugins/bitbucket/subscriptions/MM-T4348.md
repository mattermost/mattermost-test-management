## MM-T4348: Continue to use bitbucket username if user is not connected on Mattermost server

---

**Step 1**

1\. Disconnect the test user from BitBucket\
2\. Perform any acrions that will post an event with the current subscription

**Expected**

User's name in Bitbucket is shown instead of any Mattermost user name.\
Example: _"DylanH20 just deleted branch \[DHaussermann/hello-world:ping]"_
