## MM-T3951: Circle CI Subscriptions post build results

**Precondition**

These test require that you connect to Circle CI with a GitHub user who has access to these 2 public repos.\
https\://github.com/DHaussermann/hello-world\
https\://github.com/DHaussermann/mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes\
\
Contact Dylan if invites are needed.\
\
**Note:**\
This functionality works with _mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes_ because a 3rd party Orb was added in the .yaml build instructions. To make the webhook for this work with a different repo, the steps at https\://github.com/nathanaelhoun/circleci-orb-mattermost-plugin-notify must be followed.

---

**Step 1**

Create a subscription that will post if pipeline fails or succeed\
\
1\. /circleci subscription add --project gh/DHaussermann/mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes\
2\. Follow steps here <https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nathanaelhoun/mattermost-plugin-notify> to add an orb to your project pipeline (or use the Custom attributes project)\
3\. As instructed, add the environment variable for the webhook to your project

**Expected**

On 1. The plugin shows:\
_"1. Setup the Mattermost Plugin Notify Orb for your CircleCI project\
2\. Add the MM\_WEBHOOK environment variable to your project using the CircleCI UI or withPost confirms that project has been successfully set"_\
On 3. /circleci project env add MM\_WEBHOOK [https://\<MM URL>/plugins/com.github.mattermost.plugin-circleci/hooks/AXwbcu5XAgCyXWx0pUnD\_V42CZLC5yFQ](https://dkh-5-33-release.test.mattermost.cloud/plugins/com.github.mattermost.plugin-circleci/hooks/AXwbcu5XAgCyXWx0pUnD_V42CZLC5yFQ)

---

**Step 2**

Trigger a passing build\
1\. /circleci pipeline trigger branch master\
2\. Confirm that the expected build is running on the Circle Ci side\
3\. Wait for the build to succeed

**Expected**

Subscription post is show with data about passing build in the channel from step 1.

---

**Step 3**

Trigger a failing build (by invalidating yml configuration)\
1\. In GitHub navigate to https\://github.com/DHaussermann/mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes/tree/master/.circleci and edit _config.yml_\
2\. Edit line _**116**_ to read \_`name: Building Plugin \*\*hippo-\*\*Bundle`\_\
3\. Edit line **121** to read _\`\*\*hippo-\*\*printf "Supported Mattermost Server Versions: \*\*$(cat plugin.json | jq .min\_server\_version -r)+\*\* \n## Enhancements\n\n## Fixes\n" >> dist/release-notes.md_\
4\. Push the commit to _master_ (Or open a PR than merge it to _master_ if you lack permissions)\
5\. Return to Mattermost and type _/circleci pipeline trigger branch master_\
6\. Confirm that the expected build is running on the Circle Ci side\
7\. Wait for the build to fail

**Test Data**

\*\*Note: \*\*\
For steps 2. and 3. - Revert this commit after to make the build succeed again

**Expected**

Subscription post is show with data about failing build.\\

---

**Step 4**

Delete a subscription\
1\. /circleci subscription remove --project gh/DHaussermann/mattermost-plugin-custom-attributes\
2\. /circleci subscription list

**Expected**

Subscription is not shown

---

**Step 5**

Subscribing to "Failed build only" shows failed builds\
1\. _/circleci subscription add --only-failed_\
2\. _/circleci pipeline trigger branch master_\
3\. Verify in Circle CI that the pipeline is running\
4\. Wait for the build to fail\
5\. Return to the Mattermost channel

_Important notes about this step:_

Build should still be in a failing state from commit made in step 3.

**Expected**

Subscription post is show with data about failing build.\\

---

**Step 6**

Subscribing to "Failed build only" does not show successful builds\
1\. Revert the commit made in step 3. so that the _config.yml_ is once again valid\
2\. Ensure the subscription created in step 5. is still in place\
3\. Type _/circleci pipeline trigger branch master_\
3\. Verify in Circle CI that the pipeline is running\
4\. Wait for the build tosucceed\
5\. Return to the Mattermost channel

_Important notes about this step:_

Build should still be in a failing state from commit made in step 3.

**Expected**

The subscription did \*\*not \*\*make a post
