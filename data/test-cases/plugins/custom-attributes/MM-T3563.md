## MM-T3563: LDAP grous can be passed in instead of user id

---

**Step 1**

1\. Add a group ID to a custom attribute record\
2\. Confirm a member of the target LDAP group that is not listed in the IDs section (as you will be adding the group they are part of instead of listing the user individually)\
3\. Locate one or more members of the target group

**Expected**

All members of the group show the info on pop-over
