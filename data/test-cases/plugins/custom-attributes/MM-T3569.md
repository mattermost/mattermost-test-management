**Step 1**

1\. Add a custom attribute with 2 teams as part of the criteria\
2\. Naviagte to the user side\
3\. Locate a user who is part of both teams and click the profile icon to bring up the pop-over\
4\. Remove user from 1 of the teams\
5\. Naviagte to the user side and open the pop-over again

**Expected**

On 3. the custom attribute has been applied to the user\
On 5. the custom attribute has still applied to the user as it is applied when you are a member of any traget team
