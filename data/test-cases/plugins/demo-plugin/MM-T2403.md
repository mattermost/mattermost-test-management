## MM-T2403: Demo plugin - theme

---

**Step 1**

Demo plugin - theme\
————————————————————————————

1. With demo-plugin enabled (see above; plugin upload is enabled on postgres.test as well as the Se server), change theme in Account Settings ➜ Display\
   \
   (Easiest to test on a multi-team account, then cycle through different themes on different teams)

**Expected**

- The demo plugin should display the icon at the bottom of the team sidebar theme legibly according to each theme
