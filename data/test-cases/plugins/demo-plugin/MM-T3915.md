## MM-T3915: Demo plugin user's last name updates via websocket

---

**Step 1**

1\. Install and enable the demo plugin\
2\. In a different browser session open a DM with the newly created demo plugin user (the user not the bot)\
3\. In the first session as the admin update the `Demo User Last Name` value by selecting a different value and save (do not change the username)\
4\. Return to the 2nd session and check the user profile pop-over for the demo plugin user in the DM - Do **not** refresh the browser

**Expected**

Websocket even successfully updated the userâ€™s last name. No need to refresh the browser.
