## MM-T5205: Force GIF preview before posting (force /gifs):

---

**Step 1**

1\. Set Force GIF preview before posting (force /gifs) to true\
2\. Ensure that only \`gifs\` is shown when you type \`/gif\` and the preview comes up when using the plugin\
3\. Set Force GIF preview before posting (force /gifs) to false\
4\. Ensure that both \`gif\` and \`gifs\` comes up when you type \`/gif\`\
5\. Type \`/gif pickles\`

**Expected**

On 2. gifs is displayed and there is no way to post without the preview\
On 4. gif and gifs are both displayed\
On 5. \`gif\` is usable and post a gif without the preview
