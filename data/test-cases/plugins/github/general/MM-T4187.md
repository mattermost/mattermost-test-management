## MM-T4187: GitHub links show pop-over in main thread

---

**Step 1**

1\. Open a channel and post a GitHub link (ideally a public repo) such as: https\://github.com/DHaussermann/hello-world/issues/141\
2\. Mouse over the ink in the main thread

**Expected**

\- Pop-over is shown in main thread\
\- Pop-over resolution is reasonable\
\- Text wraps to fit into pop-over\
\- Additional text is truncated\
\- User theme is applied
