## MM-T4214: exclude-org-member hides events from members of an org

---

**Step 1**

1\. Subscribe to an org such as /github subscribe dkh-org/Hello-World --exclude-org-member\
2\. As a member (ex: Collaborator or administrator) of the organization perform an action that would deliver an event such as creating an Issue, Branch or PR

_Important notes about this step:_

**Must be an org. Cannot use personal workspace**\
\
**For the user causing the event - Their membership must be public so the plugin knows they are members**

**Expected**

No event is delivered via the subscription
