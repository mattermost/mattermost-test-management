## MM-T4216: Add user to mute list

---

**Step 1**

(Required 2 different mattermost user Connected with Different Github account)\
1\. Login With (Test-user) GitHub-user and comment on a test users OR or Issue with the @mention Original Github-User.\
2\. Login to Mattermost as the Original-user.\
3\. type /github mute add from step 1. (/github mute add test-user)\
4\. type /github mute list to confirm user was added\
5\. Return to GitHub as the Test-user again and comment on the same Original-users issue.

_Important notes about this step:_

**Working webhook pointed at the server must be in place**\
**This functionality does not apply to at mentions. It mutes comments without at mention on issues and PRs you own.**

**Expected**

On 1. GitHub bot will DM the Original user when comment is added\
On 4. Tes-GitHub-user has been muted.
