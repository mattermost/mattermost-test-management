**Step 1**

1. Setup the `GitHub` plugin in Mattermost.
2. Open any channel or DM/GM in Mattermost.
3. Create a subscription of a repository without any `label`.
4. Create a new `Issue` or `Pull Request` in `GitHub` under that repository.
5. Go back to the channel or DM/GM in Mattermost where the subscription was created.

**Expected**

The user should receive a notification for the created `Issue` or `Pull Request` in the channel or DM/GM where the subscription was set.

**Step 2**

1. Setup the `GitHub` plugin in Mattermost.
2. Open any channel or DM/GM in Mattermost.
3. Create a subscription of a repository with a `label`.
4. Create a new `Issue` or `Pull Request` in `GitHub` with that same `label`.
5. Go back to the channel or DM/GM in Mattermost where the subscription was created.

**Expected**

The user should get a notification about the new `Issue` or `Pull Request` created and should mention the subscribed `label`

**Step 3**

1. Setup the `GitHub` plugin in Mattermost.
2. Open any channel or DM/GM in Mattermost.
3. Create a subscription of a repository with a `label`.
4. Create a new `Issue` or `Pull Request` in `GitHub` with a different `label`.
5. Go back to the channel or DM/GM in Mattermost where the subscription was created.

**Expected**

The user should not get any notification because the created `Issue` or `Pull Request` does not include the subscribed `label`.

**Step 4**

1. Setup the `GitHub` plugin in Mattermost.
2. Open any channel or DM/GM in Mattermost.
3. Create a subscription of a repository with a `label`.
4. Create a new `Issue` or `Pull Request` in `GitHub` with multiple `labels`, including the subscribed `label`.
5. Go back to the channel or DM/GM in Mattermost where the subscription was created.

**Expected**

The user should get a notification about the new `Issue` or `Pull Request`. The notification should mention the subscribed `label`, while the labels should also appear in the `labels` list in the notification.

**Step 5**

1. Setup the `GitHub` plugin in Mattermost.
2. Open any channel or DM/GM in Mattermost.
3. Create a subscription of a repository with a `label`.
4. Create a new `Issue` or `Pull Request` in `GitHub` with no `labels` assigned.
5. Go back to the channel or DM/GM in Mattermost where the subscription was created.

**Expected**

The user should not get any notification because the `Issue` or Pull `Request` does not have the subscribed label.
