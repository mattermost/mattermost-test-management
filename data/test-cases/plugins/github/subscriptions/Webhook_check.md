**Step 1**

1. Remove the existing webhook if present for any desired repository or organization on Github.
2. Create a subscription to the desired repository or organization using the slash command `/github subscribe add <repository or organization> --feature <feature>` in the desired channel or DM/GM on MM.

**Expected**

The user will get an ephemeral message regarding `no webhook was found for the desired repository or organization` along with the successful subscription message in the desired channel or DM/GM on MM.
