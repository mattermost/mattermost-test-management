**Step 1**

1\. Within a GitLab group create a Subgroup\
2\. For that Subgroup create a webhook\
3\. Crete a subscripton to the subgroup in the channel: "/gitlab subscribe dkh-test-group/dkh-sub-group-1"\
4\. In GitHub cause an event to happen that is included in the subscription features such as issue creation

Events in any project within the target subgroup are delivered via a shared webhook
