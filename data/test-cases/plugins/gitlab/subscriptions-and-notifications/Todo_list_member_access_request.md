**Step 1**

1. Create a `member access request` from a different user to any one of your desired public project/group on Gitlab.
2. Navigate to the desired channel or DM/GM on MM and enter the slash command `/gitlab todo`.

**Expected**

The user should get a list of todo in the desired channel or DM/GM on MM and the notification for member access request should follow the format, `member_access_requested : <user> has requested access to <owner/repo>`.
