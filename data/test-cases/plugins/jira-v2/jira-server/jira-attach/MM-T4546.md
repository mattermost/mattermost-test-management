## MM-T4546: Files under 10MB can be attached

**Step 1**

1\. Ensure that attachment size limit is enabled and set to the default 10MB\
2\. Make a post in Mattermost that contains a file attachment smaller than 10MB\
3\. Open the post menu and select attach to Jira\
4\. In the attach modal that opens, search for and select a Jira issue\
5\. Attach the comment to the issue\
6\. Open the Jira issue in a browser (can click the link posted after 4.)

**Expected**

On 4. the Jira plugin post a reply to the post confirming that post was attached and provides a link to the issue\
On 5. the comment created via Mattermost post contains the file attachment
