## MM-T4547: Files over 10MB can be attached

---

**Step 1**

1\. Ensure that attachment size limit is enabled and set to the default 10 MB\
2\. Make a post in Mattermost that contains a file attachment larger than 10 MB\
3\. Open the post menu and select attach to Jira\
4\. In the attach modal that opens, search for and select a Jira issue\
5\. Attach the comment to the issue\
6\. Open the Jira issue in a browser (can click the link posted after 4.)

**Expected**

On 4. the Jira plugin sends you a DM informing you that the attachment was not made as the size limit was exceeded\
On 5. the comment created via Mattermost post is visible in Jira without the file attachment
