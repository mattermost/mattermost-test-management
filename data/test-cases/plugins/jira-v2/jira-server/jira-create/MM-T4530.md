3\. Navigate to Settings >> Issues >> Custom fields and create a field of type date field\
4\. Set the target custom filed you've created as mandatory from Settings >> Issues >> Field Configuration by modyfing the filed configuration used by the target project and issue type from step 1.\
5\. Return to mattermost and connect as a user who has access to create issues in the project from step 2. above\
6\. Create and issue in the project where the field from step 3. will be mandatory but not show in the modal\
7\. Poulate all available fields and note that the mandatory custom field is not shown\
