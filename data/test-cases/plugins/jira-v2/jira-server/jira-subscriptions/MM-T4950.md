2\. From Mattermost, open the subscribe modal in a channel by typing \`/jira subscribe\
3\. Select a project and enter a name\
4\. Add any event and issue type then save\
5\. Edit the subscription created above and click Save Subscription again without saving any data

_Important notes about this step:_

This tested for an odd bug that only occured when there was 1 single subscription created

On 5. Subscription re-saves without issue and the user is returned to the subscription list
