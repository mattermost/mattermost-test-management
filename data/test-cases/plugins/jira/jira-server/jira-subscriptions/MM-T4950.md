---

**Step 1 from MM-T4949: Setup a subscription**

<!-- (Auto-generated) Note: Step 1.1 should not be updated here. Instead, modify directly to the referenced MM-T4949 test case. -->

_**Step 1.1**_

1\. Install and ebable Jira plugin\
2\. Run /jira webhook to get the webhook URL\
3\. Navigate to Jira Setting >> System >> Webhooks\
4\. Create a new webhook with URL of https\:///plugins/jira/api/v2/webhook?secret= using the webhook secret from Jira config\
5\. Check all events related to issue change and comment functionality\
6\. Save the webhook

_**Expected**_

Subscriptions Webhook created

---

**Step 2**

1\. Ensure there are not yet any subscriptions on the server\
2\. From Mattermost, open the subscribe modal in a channel by typing \`/jira subscribe\
3\. Select a project and enter a name\
4\. Add any event and issue type then save\
5\. Edit the subscription created above and click Save Subscription again without saving any data

_Important notes about this step:_

This tested for an odd bug that only occurred when there was 1 single subscription created

**Expected**

On 4. Subscription is saved\
On 5. Subscription re-saves without issue and the user is returned to the subscription list
