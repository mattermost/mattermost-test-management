## MM-T5452: No security group options shown when a project has no security groups available

---

**Step 1**

1. In Jira, create or locate a target project that has a set of security groups associated to it
2. In Mattermost select a channel and create a new subscription
3. Select the target project from step 1. and add some events
4. Add one of the security levels for the project
5. In Jira locate (or create) an issue that is part of the security level not selected in the filter above
6. For the Jira issue above, trigger an event included in the subsrciption

**Expected**

The even is not delivered as the security level is outside the scope of the subscription
