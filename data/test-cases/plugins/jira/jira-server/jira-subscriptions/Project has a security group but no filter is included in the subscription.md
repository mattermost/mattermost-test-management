**Step 1**

1. In Jira, create or locate a target project has a set of security groups associated to it
2. In Mattermost select a channel and create a new subscription
3. Select the target project from step 1. and add some events
4. Save the subscription without adding a filter
5. In jira trigger an event included in the subscription

**Expected**

- Above the "approximate SQL" box the text '"security level" is empty' is shown
- The event is not delivered as there is not security level applied
