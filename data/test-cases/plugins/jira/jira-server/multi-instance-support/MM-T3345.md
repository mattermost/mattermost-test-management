---

**Step 1**

1\. Use /cloud to create a Mattermost sever with an E20 license\
2\. Login to the new MM server and install the Jira V2.4 plugin

_Important notes about this step:_

There are several other valid ways this could be setup on existing Mattermost servers

**Expected**

The instance select drop down is shown along with the 2 connected instances

---

**Step 2**

1\. Type /_Jira install \<cloud or server> \<Jira URL>_\
_ex: /jira install cloud https\://mmtest.atlassian.net_\
_2. _Type_ /jira instance connect \<jira URL> to connect to the newly installed instance_

**Expected**

Instance is successfully installed and user can connect

---

**Step 3**

1\. Migrate the instance by upgrading the plugin to Jira V3\
2\. Type _/jira instance list_

**Expected**

Table shows that legacy instance has been migrated

---

**Step 4**

1\. Type \_/jira instance install \<cloud / server> \<jira URL> \_to install a 2nd instance of Jira\
_2. _Type_ /jira instance connect \<jira URL>_ to connect to the newly installed instance

**Expected**

User is connected to 2 instances

---

**Step 5**

1\. Open the Jira config and add a Jira permission group that does not exists in either instance such as `_not-a-real-group_`

**Expected**

Jira group permission added to restrict subscription functionality

---

**Step 6**

1\. Type _/jira subscription edit_\
2\. _Click Add_\_

**Expected**

\- Legacy Jira instance is no longer available for subscriptions functionality as the group does not exist\
\- Subscribe functionality for 2nd Jira instance is nor affected by Kira permission group restriction
