1\. In center, post the following:\
/poll "Do you like https\://mattermost.com?"\
2\. Click Yes or No\
3\. Click to reply on any message to open the RHS\
4\. In RHS, post \`/poll Reply\`\
5\. Another user clicks Yes or No

**Expected**

\
Mattermost URL renders as a live link\
\
After clicking Yes or No, ephemeral message displays "Your vote has been counted"\
