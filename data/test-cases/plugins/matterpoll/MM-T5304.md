**Step 1**

1\. Organize a poll and ensure that the multi-vote setting is not enabled. i.e ensure that you do not set the flag --votes=X\
2\. Start the poll

**Expected**

on 2. There should be a reset vote button that allows you to reset the poll. Upon clicking it, the poll should reset back to its initial state.
