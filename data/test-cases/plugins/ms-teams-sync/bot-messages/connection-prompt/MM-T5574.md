## MM-T5574: Connection prompt in direct message with Mattermost primary user

**Precondition**

Disconnect from MS Teams, if necessary, via `/msteams disconnect`.

---

**Step 1**

Send a direct message to a user who has chosen Mattermost as their primary platform, or who is simply not connected to Teams.

**Expected**

Verify no ephemeral message displayed in chat, as there is no need to connect to Microsoft Teams.
