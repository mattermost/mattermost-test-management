## MM-T5575: Connection prompt in group message with one remote user

**Precondition**

Disconnect from MS Teams, if necessary, via `/msteams disconnect`.

---

**Step 1**

Send a group message to a remote user (e.g. `@msteams_user`) and a user who has chosen Mattermost as their primary platform (or simply not connected to Teams).

**Expected**

Verify ephemeral message displayed in chat:
