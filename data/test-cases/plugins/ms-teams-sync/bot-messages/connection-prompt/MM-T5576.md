**Precondition**

Disconnect from MS Teams, if necessary, via `/msteams disconnect`.

**Step 1**

Send a group message to a user who has chosen Teams as their primary platform and a user who has chosen Mattermost as their primary platform (or simply not connected to Teams).

**Expected**

Verify ephemeral message displayed in chat:
