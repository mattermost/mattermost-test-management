## MM-T5577: Connection prompt in group message with only Mattermost primary users

**Precondition**

Disconnect from MS Teams, if necessary, via `/msteams disconnect`.

---

**Step 1**

Send a group message to two users who have chosen chosen Mattermost as their primary platform (or simply not connected to Teams).

**Expected**

Verify no ephemeral message displayed in chat, as there is no need to connect to Microsoft Teams.
