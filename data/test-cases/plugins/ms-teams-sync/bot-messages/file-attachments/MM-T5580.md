## MM-T5580: No file attachment warning when disabled and sending to a Mattermost primary user

**Precondition**

- Disable synchronization of file attachments. (Set `syncfileattachments` to `false` in plugin configuration.)
- Connect to MS Teams.

---

**Step 1**

Send a direct message with a file attachment to a user who has chosen Mattermost as their primary platform, or who is simply not connected to Teams.

**Expected**

Verify no warning message displayed in chat, as attachments are delivered to Mattermost users normally.
