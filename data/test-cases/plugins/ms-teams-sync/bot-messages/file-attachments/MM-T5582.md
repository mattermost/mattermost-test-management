## MM-T5582: File attachment warning when disabled and sending to a group message with one Teams primary user

**Precondition**

- Disable synchronization of file attachments. (Set `syncfileattachments` to `false` in plugin configuration.)
- Connect to MS Teams.

---

**Step 1**

Send a group message with a file attachment to a user who has chosen Teams as their primary platform and a user who has chosen Mattermost as their primary platform (or simply not connected to Teams).

**Expected**

Verify message displayed in chat:

> Attachments sent from Mattermost aren't yet delivered to Microsoft Teams.
