## MM-T5583: No file attachment warning when disabled and sending to a group message with only Mattermost primary users

**Precondition**

- Disable synchronization of file attachments. (Set `syncfileattachments` to `false` in plugin configuration.)
- Connect to MS Teams.

---

**Step 1**

Send a group message with a file attachment to two users who have chosen chosen Mattermost as their primary platform (or simply not connected to Teams).

**Expected**

Verify no warning message displayed in chat, as attachments are delivered to Mattermost users normally.
