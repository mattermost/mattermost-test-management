**Step 1**

**Scenario**: User has selected MSTeams as primary platform

1. Connect Mattermost account.
2. Link a channel using command `/msteams-sync link <msteams-teams-id> <msteams-channel-id>`.
3. Log into your MSTeams app and send a message in linked channel.
4. Verify that on Mattermost, the user does not not get notification ping for the DMs/GMs and synced channels that are muted on the Mattermost app.
