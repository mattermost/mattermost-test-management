## MM-T5493: Link channel slash command

---

**Step 1**

1. Run the `/msteams-sync link <msteams-teams-id> <msteams-channel-id>` command in the desired MM channel by the account of the user who have all the channel permissions.

---

**Step 2**

1. Run the `/msteams-sync link <msteams-teams-id> <msteams-channel-id>` when the desired channel is already linked to a MS Teams channel by the account of the user who have all the channel permissions.

**Expected**

The user should be able to link the desired MM channel to the desired MS Teams channel. Also, on step 2, the user should receive a message that this channel is already linked to a MS Teams channel.
