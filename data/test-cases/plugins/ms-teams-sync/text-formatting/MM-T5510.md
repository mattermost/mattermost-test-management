## MM-T5510: LaTeX formatting currently not expected to render on MS Teams side

---

**Step 1**

1. In a linked channel, post the following LaTeX-formatted text from Mattermost side:Three ticks immediately followed by `latex`, newline, "X\_k = \sum\_{n=0}^{2N-1} x\_n \cos \left\[\frac{\pi}{N} \left(n+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{N}{2}\right) \left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) \right]" without the quotes, newline, three ticks

\`\`\`latex\
X\_k = \sum\_{n=0}^{2N-1} x\_n \cos \left\[\frac{\pi}{N} \left(n+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{N}{2}\right) \left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) \right]

\`\`\`

1. View post in linked channel in MS Teams

**Expected**

Until further notice this is known and expected behavior:

- LaTeX does not render properly on MS Teams side; just appears as a text block
- LaTeX renders properly on Mattermost side, e.g.:

$X\_k = \sum\_{n=0}^{2N-1} x\_n \cos \left\[\frac{\pi}{N} \left(n+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{N}{2}\right) \left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) \right]$

---

**Step 2**

1. In a linked channel, post the following LaTeX-formatted text from Mattermost side (dollar sign before and following the LaTeX portion):

   `Using dollar sign to format: $\cos \left[\frac{\pi}{N} \left(n+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{N}{2}\right) \left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) \right]$`
