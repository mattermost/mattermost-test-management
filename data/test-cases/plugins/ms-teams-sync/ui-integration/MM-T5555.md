## MM-T5555: Error while connecting a user through RHS

---

**Step 1**

1. Any error occurred while connecting the user to their MS Teams account.

**Expected**

The current RHS state should persist and a toast message should appear in the RHS of MS Teams sync plugin regarding the failure of the user account connection due to an error.
