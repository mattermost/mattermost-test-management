## MM-T1958: Marketplace is available when “Enable Marketplace” is set to true

---

**Step 1**

Marketplace is available when “Enable Marketplace” is set to true\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Go to main menu > System Console > PLUGINS > Plugin Management.\
2\. Set “Enable Marketplace” to true and hit the “Save” button at the bottom.\
3\. Switch to a Mattermost team.\
4\. Click on the product switcher icon (top left) to open menu.

_Important notes about this step:_

This test is to verify the UI component in the System Console's "Plugin Management" page instead of changing the plugin settings through the server config file.

**Expected**

“Marketplace” is available in the main menu
