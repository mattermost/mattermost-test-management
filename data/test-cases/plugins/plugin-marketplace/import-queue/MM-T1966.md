## MM-T1966: Marketplace is not accessible when URL is invalid

---

**Step 1**

Marketplace is not accessible when URL is invalid\
————————————————————————————\
To test this reliably, remove the prepackaged\_plugins folder from the path (has to be done locally), then turn "Enable Automatic Prepackaged Plugins" off. Then restart server.\
1\. In the “Marketplace URL” field, change the value to https\://example.com\
2\. Hit the “Save” button.\
3\. Switch to a Mattermost team.\
4\. Go to main menu > System Console > Plugins Marketplace.

**Expected**

1\. The Plugins Marketplace modal launches\
2\. The modal displays an error message “Error connecting to the marketplace server. Please check your settings in the System Console.”
