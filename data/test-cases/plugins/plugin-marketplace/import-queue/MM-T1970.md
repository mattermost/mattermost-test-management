## MM-T1970: Marketplace is available when URL is set to local marketplace (verifying that multiple urls work)

**Precondition**

This should be tested on a local instance, with a local marketplace running.

---

**Step 1**

Marketplace is available when URL is set to local marketplace (verifying that multiple urls work)\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Setup marketplace to run at http\://localhost:8085.\
2\. Go back to the Plugins Management page (click on the System Console link in the error message).\
3\. Change the URL in the “Marketplace URL” field to “http\://localhost:8085”\
4\. Hit the “Save” button.\
5\. Switch to a Mattermost team.\
6\. Go to main menu > System Console > Plugins Marketplace.

**Expected**

1\. The Plugins Marketplace modal launches.\
2\. The Plugins Marketplace launches normally without any errors and shows all the available and installed plugins.
