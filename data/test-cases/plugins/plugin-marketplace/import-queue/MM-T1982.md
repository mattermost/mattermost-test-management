## MM-T1982: Verify the expected pre-packaged plugins from Marketplace install successfully

---

**Step 1**

Installing pre-packaged plugins from Marketplace installs all plugins successfully\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Open App Marketplace from the main grid menu\
2\. Compare available plugins to the pre-packaged list in the release branch's Makefile (e.g. https\://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/release-9.11/server/Makefile#L145 for v9.11)\
3\. Note that Playbooks will only show one version in the Marketplace, based on the server's license\
4\. Also note that Boards is not expected to appear in the Marketplace\
5\. Install each plugin in the list (if not installed already) and verify it's the correct version (from the list in Makefile)

**Expected**

1\. Pre-packaged plugins are available in the App Marketplace\
2\. Pre-packaged plugins can be installed and show the correct version for that release
