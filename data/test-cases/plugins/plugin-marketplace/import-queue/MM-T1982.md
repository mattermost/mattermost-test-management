## MM-T1982: Verify the expected pre-packaged plugins from Marketplace install successfully

---

**Step 1**

Installing pre-packaged plugins from Marketplace installs all plugins successfully\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Open App Marketplace from the main grid menu\
2\. Compare available plugins to the pre-packaged list in the release branch's Makefile (e.g. https\://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/release-9.11/server/Makefile#L145 for v9.11)\
3\. Install each plugin in the list and verify it's the correct version (from the list in Makefile)\
4\. Enable and start each plugin, then disable and remove

**Expected**

1\. Pre-packaged plugins are available in the App Marketplace\
2\. Pre-packaged plugins can be installed and show the correct version for that release
