3\. Wait for plugin to install.\
4\. On a third tab, go to System Console > Plugin Management.\
5\. Remove Demo plugin.\
6\. Install Zoom plugin v1.0.5 by uploading the tar.gz file.\
7\. Ensure that the plugin is installed.\
8\. Go to the 2nd tab (the “Install” button for the installed plugin in step 2 should still say “Install” and not “Configure”).\
