## MM-T1992: Typing the name of plugins in search box reduces the displayed set of plugins to match search term

---

**Step 1**

Typing the name of plugins in search box reduces the displayed set of plugins to match search term\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Launch Plugin Marketplace\
2\. In the search box up top in the marketplace modal, type the letters “an”.\
3\. Continue typing “anti”.

**Expected**

1\. With each keystroke the list gets shorter.\
2\. Antivirus (and any other plugin that has the term “anti”) is the only remaining plugin on the list.
