**Step 1**

2\. Locate a test server that has access to the S3 bucket for AWS\
3\. Ensure you can modify the proxy plugin and compile it locally

_Important notes about this step:_

\*\*None of this should be needed once the apps are in \*\***production**

**Expected**

Apps plugin can be installed

1\. Ensure the plugin manifest has a record for the app you're targeting ex _"com.mattermost.servicenow": "0.1.7"_\
2\. Build the plugin and deploy it\
3\. Type _/apps list_ and ensure your plugin is visible\
4\. Open the marketplace\
5\. Click install next to your app (such as Service Now)\
6\. Click approve and install in the modal

**Expected**

On 4. The target app is listed in the marketplace\
On 5. App-installation modal appears\
On 6. App is successfully installed

---

**Step 3**

1\. Modify the Apps plugin manifest and remove the record for the AWS lambda app above\
2\. Compile the plugin and upload it to the same server as above\
3\. Go to the user side and check to see if the autocomplete option is still available\
4\. Type _apps list_\\
