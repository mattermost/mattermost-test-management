## MM-T5884: Delete a root post

---

**Step 1**

1. Post a root message with one or more replies. A root post could be:

- with or without attachments
- with or without reactions
- with attachment only and without message

1. Verify that the "Remove root post" option is visible in the root post's menu.
2. Select "Remove root post".

**Expected**

The "Remove root post" option should be available for a root post. When selected, the root message is replaced with `*Deleted*` (default), attachments and reactions are removed, the root post is marked as `Edited`, and the thread remains unchanged. After deletion, the "Remove root post" option is no longer visible for the root post.

---

**Step 2**

1. Navigate to `System Console > PLUGINS > Post Delete Helper` and change the `Message text to be used after deletion` to a custom value (e.g. `(root post deleted)`)
2. Post a root message with one or more replies.
3. Verify that the "Remove root post" option is visible in the root post's menu.
4. Select "Remove root post".

**Expected**

The "Remove root post" option should be available for the root post. When selected, the root message is replaced with the custom text `(root post deleted)`, the root post is marked as `Edited`, and the thread remains unchanged.
