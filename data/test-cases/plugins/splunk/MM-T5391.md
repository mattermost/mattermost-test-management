## MM-T5391: Setup Splunk

---

**Step 1**

1\. Get the Docker file from here `https\://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-splunk/tree/master/dev`\
2\. In the `default.yml` located in the same folder, set the host that will expose the API (defaulted to port 8089 in the Docker compose file)\
\
**NOTE** I don't know a way of running the image on a Mac with M1 ARM CPU. If you have Docker on Mac, the image must run on Intel CPU

**Expected**

Docker container is up and running.

---

**Step 2**

1\. Start up the docker container\
2\. Exposed the API using ngrok or access it via local host\
NOTE: **The API is not** exposed at the same end point as the webapp. With the stock docker config the webapp is available at port 8000 and the API that the integration must point to is exposed at port 8089\
3\. Install the plugin and authenticate by sending your username and token to the end point where he API is exposed. (all web requests pointed at the Splunk webapp will simply 404)

**Expected**

User can Authenticate into Splunk.
