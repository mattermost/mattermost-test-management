---

**Step 1**

1\. launch a Zoom meeting using the header icon

_Important notes about this step:_

Note that this test can be run with Zomm configured using any authentication method.

**Expected**

\- Zoom plugin makes a post in the target channel\
\- Without having to click the "Join Meeting" button, a new browser tab will open and prompt the user to launch the meeting (On desktop a browser window will open)
