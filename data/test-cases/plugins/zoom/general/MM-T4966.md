## MM-T4966: Start a Zoom meeting requires permissions to make a post

---

**Step 1**

1\. Configure Mattermost permissions such that only channel admins can post\
2\. Login as a user and open a channel where you are not an admin and can't post\
3\. Use the channel header icon to create a Zoom meeting

_Important notes about this step:_

Channel moderation is also an easy way to do the setup here

**Expected**

Zoom meeting cannot be created as user cannot post
