## MM-T4966: Start a Zoom meeting requires permissions to make a post

---

**Step 1**

1\. Configure Mattermost permissions such that only channel admins can post\
2\. Login as a user and open a channel where you are not an admin and can't post\
3\. Use the channel header icon to create a Zoom meeting

_Important notes about this step:_

Channel moderation is also an easy way to do the setup here![](https://smartbear-tm4j-prod-us-west-2-attachment-rich-text.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/embedded-f3277290f945470c4add5d21ef3dc7ca7b74388fc7152bfb6b99ae58c66a95a8-1659996985457-1659996985457.png)

**Expected**

Zoom meeting cannot be created as user cannot post\
