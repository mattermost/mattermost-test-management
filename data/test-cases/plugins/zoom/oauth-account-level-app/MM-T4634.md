## MM-T4634: User tries to launch Zoom via icon and slash command when admin has not connected

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable Account Level oAuth and have a sysadmin disconnect the Mattermost instance from Zoom by typing /zoom disconnect\
2\. Login as any user with an email address that is valid to use with your Zoom app\
3\. Type /zoom start or click the Zoom icon

_Important notes about this step:_

This test requires an oAuth app on the Zoom side that uses Account-level app\
\
See steps here <https://mattermost.com/pl/mattermost-plugin-zoom>

**Expected**

User is advised Zoom is not connected and they should contact their system administrator
