## MM-T4635: Add OAuth with account level app is always set to False on install even if Oauth is true.

---

**Step 1**

1\. Install Zoom 1.5 or newer\
2\. Set Enable oAuth to true (This will enable User-level oAuth)\
3\. Save\
4\. Leave config and return

_Important notes about this step:_

This test requires an oAuth app on the Zoom side that uses Account-level app\
\
See steps here <https://mattermost.com/pl/mattermost-plugin-zoom>

**Expected**

Zoom Account Level oAuth is set to false
