## MM-T5392: Server upgrades from last stable to release version

---

**Step 1**

1. Set up a new HA server using the latest stable version with S3 as the file storage.

   - Confirm that the server has the correct version/hash, successful database migration, properly installed plugins with the correct versions, and the correct activation/deactivation of products.

   - Conduct a brief smoke test by creating users, channels, and teams, and testing log-in and log-out functionality.

     - Ensure that everything operates as expected.

   - Test the enablement, disablement, installation, and reinstallation of plugins.

     - Ensure that everything operates as expected.

   - Test the activation and deactivation of products.

     - Ensure that everything operates as expected.

   - Test the enablement and disablement of feature flags.

     - Ensure that everything operates as expected.

2. Upgrade the server to a new release version, then conduct a smoke test for each product and its core features, including:

   - Logging in and out
   - Creating, adding, and inviting users
   - Modifying system configuration
   - Sending and editing messages in a Channel
   - Creating, viewing, and moving cards of Boards
   - Starting, running, and finishing runs of Playbook
   - Making and ending Calls
   - Installing and running Apps
   - Subscribing and communicating with a Customer web server (applicable only for cloud servers).
   - Ensure that everything operates as expected.

**Expected**

When moving from the previous stable version to a new release, all features should perform as anticipated and no deterioration in functionality should be discovered. It's advisable to perform a quick check using sanity tests and smoke tests during server startup, followed by comprehensive automated tests on the release version being tested.
