- Verify User can see "Close" and "Contact Support" buttons.
- Click on "Close" button and verify user is taken to either Channels or System console > Edition and License screen depending upon from where the user started to make purchase.
- On System console > Edition and License screen, verify the instance is still on a "Free" plan and no license is loaded.
