## MM-T3020: Account creation using 'Create one now' link on signin page, email / password

---

**Step 1**

Account creation using "Create one now" link on signin page, email / password\
————————————————————————————\
Also ensure for Se that email verification is not enforced for new accounts\
1\. Ensure that System Console > SECURITY -> SIGN-UP -> ENABLE OPEN SERVER is TRUE (you're all set if the login page has a "Create one now" link)\
2\. On the sign in page, click "Don't have an account? Create one now"\
3\. Click "Email and password"\
4\. Enter email credentials for a new account\
5\. Click "Create Account"\
6\. Check your email for a verification email\
7\. Click the "Verify" link

**Expected**

Email verification is successful and account is created.\
\
All except for mobile: On the login page, email is pre-filled with focus on the password field.\
\
Won't fix: Older Edge versions don't appear to sign up successfully:\
