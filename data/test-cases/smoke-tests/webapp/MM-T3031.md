## MM-T3031: Jump from search results

---

**Step 1**

Jump from search results\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Search on a term that will have results\
2\. Click `Jump` next to a search result

**Expected**

1\. That post opens in permalink view, highlighted\
2\. Clicking link at bottom to go to recent messages no longer shows permalink view (highlight is gone, URL is channel rather than permalink, newest messages in channel appear)
