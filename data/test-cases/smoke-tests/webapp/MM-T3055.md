## MM-T3055: Add user to private channel - member icon > manage > add

---

**Step 1**

Add user to private channel - member icon > manage > add\
————————————————————————————\
1\. In another window/browser, log in as the user you are going to add to the private channel \[user2]\
2\. As user1 in the first browser, view a private channel and make a note of the number of members displayed in the member icon at the top\
3\. Click the member icon (drop-down in mobile view)\
2\. Scroll to the bottom of the member list and click Manage Members\
3\. Click “Add Members”\
4\. Select the member \[user2] you wish to add to the channel (on selection, disappears from list)\
5\. Click the “x” to close the modal

**Expected**

Se does not verify multi-user in real time; logs out and in as other user to verify\
\
1\. The added user2 sees the new channel appear in their LHS immediately, with a numbered mention badge\
2\. System message posts in channel: "\[user2] added to the channel by \[user1]", visible for both users\
3\. On user1 clicking member icon again, added user2 appears in list\
4\. The number displayed on the member icon has incremented up by 1
