————————————————————————————\
1\. In another window/browser, log in as the user you are going to remove from the public channel \[user2] and view the channel\
2\. As user1 in the first browser, click on the “v” to the right of the channel name you're going to remove user2 from\
3\. Click on “Manage Members”\
4\. Click on the "Remove" button to the right of user2

**Expected**

Se does not verify multi-users in real time; logs out and back in to verify\
\- User2 is removed from the channel\
\- User1 sees system message in channel: "\[user2] was removed from the channel"\
\- User2 sees an on-screen message "\[username] removed you from \[channel\_name]"
