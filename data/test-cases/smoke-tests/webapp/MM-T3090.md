————————————————————————————\
1\. In another window/browser, log in as the user you are going to remove from the public channel \[user2] and view the channel\

3\. Click on “Manage Members”\
4\. Click on the "Remove" button to the right of user2

**Expected**

Se does not verify multi-users in real time; logs out and back in to verify\
\- User2 is removed from the channel\
\- User1 sees system message in channel: "\[user2] was removed from the channel"\
\- User2 sees an on-screen message "\[username] removed you from \[channel\_name]"
