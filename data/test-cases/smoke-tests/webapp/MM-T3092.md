## MM-T3092: Remove a member from team

---

**Step 1**

Remove a member from team\
————————————————————————————\
1\. With a "Member" (non-admin) account, join at least two teams\
2\. As a Team Admin on one of the teams that Member joined, make it not-join-able: Team Settings > General > Allow anyone to join this team > Edit > No\
3\. On that now-private team, go to Main Menu > Manage Members\
3\. Copy the URL for that team (not an invite; just the URL)\
4\. Click "Remove user from team" next to the Member from step one\
5\. Log out\
6\. Log in to the server with the removed member's credentials\
7\. Attempt to open the URL for the team you were just removed from (copied in step 3)

**Expected**

You should not be able to open the team, and you should be redirected to the first team that appears on team sidebar.\
\
(If you only belong to one team, then team sidebar doesn't appear)
