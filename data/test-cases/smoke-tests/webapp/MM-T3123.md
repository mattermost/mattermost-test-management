## MM-T3123: GM: Create GM and post message (what message sender sees)

---

**Step 1**

GM: Create GM and post message (what message sender sees)\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Add at least two users to a GM (follow above steps to add), ensuring that it's the first message to that exact group of users\
2\. Click Go\
After step 2:\
\- Center channel displays new group message channel:\
\- "This is the start of your group message history with user1, user2 and user3.\
Messages and files shared here are not shown to people outside this area."\
\- Each user's profile picture displays, and can be clicked to display popover (with all the usual functions)\
\
3\. Type a message and click or press Enter to send.

**Expected**

After step 3:\
\- In LHS, GM name appears in DM channel list in alpha order\
\- Channel name is based on names of users in the GM: all users in the group (except the user viewing it) in alpha order (truncated if necessary)\
\- Number of members other than the user viewing appears in a small square to the left of GM channel name (e.g. 5 total in the GM, 4 shows to the left of the name, 5 shows next to member icon to the right of GM channel name in center channel)\
\- Message is posted in center channel
