Ensure that "Words that Trigger Mentions" is set to include "Channel-wide mentions `@channel`, `@all`, `@here`"\

2\. Log in with test account in a second browser\
3\. Send a message @here in a channel with fewer than 1000 members while the main account is online

**Expected**

A desktop notification should be received, and a mention notification should show up beside the channel name.
