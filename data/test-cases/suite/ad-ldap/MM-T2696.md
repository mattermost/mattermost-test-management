## MM-T2696: Invalid server name

---

**Step 1**

Invalid server name\
————————————————————————————

1. Load AD/LDAP page in system console, with all the settings filled in
2. Delete the last letter of the AD/LDAP server field so it reads for example `corp.mattermost.co`, and Save
3. At the bottom of the page, click "AD/LDAP Test"

**Expected**

- Error message saying the connection was not successful.
- Set back to correct setting such as
- corp.mattermost.com and test again (successful)
