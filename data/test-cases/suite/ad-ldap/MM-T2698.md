## MM-T2698: Connection Security setting - Incorrect

---

**Step 1**

Connection Security setting - Incorrect\
————————————————————————————

1. Load AD/LDAP page in system console
2. Set Connection Security to TLS
3. Click Save
4. Navigate to a different page in system console, like GitLab
5. Navigate back to AD/LDAP page
6. Observe TLS setting persisted
7. Click the button `AD/LDAP Test`

**Expected**

- Connection Security setting was saved successfully
- Connection test was unsuccessful
- (Then set the connection back to what it was; likely `None`, and Save)
