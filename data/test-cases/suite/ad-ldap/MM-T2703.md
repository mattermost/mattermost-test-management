## MM-T2703: Incorrect Login ID Attribute

---

**Step 1**

Incorrect Login ID Attribute\
————————————————————————————\
**Test using an LDAP account that does not yet have an account on this Mattermost server**

1. Change Login ID Attribute to be something different, such as `domainusername` and Save
2. Have an LDAP user try to create a new account using LDAP credentials, observe error message "We couldn't find an account matching your login credentials."
3. Change Login ID Attribute back to what it was before, such as `uid` or `sAMAccountName` and Save
4. Try the LDAP user account creation again

**Expected**

- After switching back to correct Login ID Attribute such as sAMAccountName, account creation is successful
