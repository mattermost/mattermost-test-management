## MM-T2715: Adding first/last and nickname attributes back in and syncing returns user's first/last names from LDAP

---

**Step 1**

Adding first/last and nickname attributes back in and syncing returns user's first/last names from LDAP\
————————————————————————————

1. Admin adds values back to first and last name and nickname attributes in LDAP
2. Admin clicks button to initiate LDAP sync
3. After sync completes, LDAP user who had changed first/last name and nickname logs back in

**Expected**

- User's first/last names and nickname are returned to be the values from LDAP (and are not editable)
