## MM-T2721: Multi-factor Authentication (AD/LDAP) - Add

---

**Step 1**

Multi-factor Authentication\
(AD/LDAP) - Add\
————————————————————————————

1. Ensure MFA is enabled on the server
2. Sign in with an account using AD/LDAP
3. On Desktop app or browser, go to Account Settings ➜ Security ➜ Multi-factor Authentication ➜ Edit
4. Click "Add MFA"
5. Instead of scanning the QR Code, use the "Secret Key" to set up MFA (select manual entry in Google Authenticator; this is done on your phone and you can have multiple MFA setups on one Authenticator account).
6. Logout
7. Login and enter the MFA code

**Expected**

- Multifactor Authentication is enabled, and login is successful only after entering the MFA code.
