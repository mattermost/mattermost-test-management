## MM-T2722: Multi-factor Authentication (AD/LDAP) - Remove Sign in Mobile apps

---

**Step 1**

Multi-factor Authentication\
(AD/LDAP) - Remove\
\
Sign in Mobile apps\
————————————————————————————

1. Sign in with an account using AD/LDAP and MFA
2. Go to Account Settings ➜ Security ➜ Multi-factor Authentication ➜ Edit
3. Disable MFA (or "Reset" if MFA enforcement is on for the server)
4. Log out
5. Use RN apps to log in again

**Expected**

- Login should be successful on RN apps without having to enter an MFA code.
- If you clicked "Reset" MFA, you should be immediately prompted to re-add it.
