## MM-T2725: 3. _Deactivate user in SAML, do not delete in LDAP:_

---

**Step 1**

3\. \*Deactivate user in SAML, do not delete in LDAP:\*\
————————————————————————————

1. In OKTA, can use the Suspend option on the user.

**Expected**

- User is not auto-logged-out, but if they log out of Mm, they can't log back in using SAML: sees signin error (Sign-in failed!) on OKTA credentials page
- Reactivate user after this test is done
