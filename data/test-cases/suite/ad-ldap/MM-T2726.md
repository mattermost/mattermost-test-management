## MM-T2726: Delete user in LDAP (or just remove them from the necessary group), do not deactivate in SAML (with sync enabled) https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-8196

---

**Step 1**

Delete user in LDAP (or just remove them from the necessary group), do not deactivate in SAML (with sync enabled)\
\
https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-8196\
————————————————————————————

1. Reactivate in SAML if using same user as above (user may need to click a link in an OKTA email to reactivate)
2. Delete or remove from group in LDAP
3. Sync LDAP

**Expected**

- After LDAP sync, user is auto-logged-out from Mm
- Trying to sign back in using SAML succeeds, but user is re-deactivated on each subsequent LDAP sync
