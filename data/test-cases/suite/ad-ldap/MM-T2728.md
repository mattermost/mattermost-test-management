## MM-T2728: SAML/LDAP sync with ID Attribute Summary of all of the test steps (This covers failure and success cases from below)

**Step 1**

SAML/LDAP sync with ID Attribute\
\
Summary of all of the test steps\
\
(This covers failure and success cases from below)\
————————————————————————————

1. rc.test.mattermost.com:

   - In OKTA: Applications ➜ rc.test ➜ General ➜ Attributes (idAttr already set up with user.firstName)
   - In Mm: SAML ➜ Override SAML bind data with AD/LDAP information: true
   - In Mm: SAML ➜ ID Attribute = idAttr (in OneLogin I did FirstName)
   - In Mm: Log in using OKTA or create new Mm account using OKTA, with an account that has a different first name in OKTA vs. user ID (uid) in LDAPIn Mm: Sync LDAP
   - OKTA user log out and try to log back in using OKTA ➜ Error "This account does not use SAML authentication. Please sign in using email and password" or "An account with that username already exists. Please contact your Administrator"
   - In OKTA: Change first name to match Jumpcloud uid such as "test.two"
   - Back to Mattermost, try to log in again ➜ Success, user info from OKTA, with first name the same as the LDAP username such as "test.two"
   - Sync LDAP
   - OKTA user refresh ➜ user info from LDAP
   - In Mm SAML: Remove idAttr and disable SAML override on SAML page
   - In OKTA: Change OKTA user's first name back so it doesn't match LDAP uid
   - OKTA user log out and back in using SAML ➜ Error as before (expected that admin would then have to go in and delete all the accounts to make room for the new person, rather than the new person inadvertently accessing the "old" account)

**Cleanup**:

- Admin change the OKTA account in Mm to email/password, then that user log in to Mm and change email & username
