## MM-T2729: SAML / LDAP sync with ID Attribute set (summary of what brought on this feature)

---

**Step 1**

SAML / LDAP sync with ID Attribute set (summary of what brought on this feature)\
————————————————————————————\
**The originating test case is:**

1. User exists, can log in with SAML and LDAP sync
2. User leaves the company (for example)
3. A new person arrives at the company with the same name, and by convention is assigned the same email address and username as the former employee
4. Without using the ID Attribute, even if the admin deletes the old and creates a new account for this user in SAML / LDAP, if nothing was done to change the user in Mattermost, the new user will log in and see all of the old user's history (because they have the same username / email address in Mattermost)
5. With the ID Attribute in use, each SAML account gets an ID Attribute that is used to verify the user's identity in Mattermost (overriding the user of email address to identify the user), so the new user will not be able to sign in using the new SAML account; they will see an error saying there is already an account with that username. At that point, they can alert their system admin, who can then go into Mattermost and remove the colliding username/email address, and then the new user will be able to log in and they will have a fresh, new Mattermost account

**Expected**

**Note**: LM copied notes from testing below; they are from very specific setup in OKTA and Jumpcloud. LM will go back through again and 1) make sure she understands how to make this work in OneLogin for example, and 2) update the test steps below to make them testable in future release testing
