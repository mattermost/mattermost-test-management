**Step 1**

Without ID Attribute set\

1. Created user with SAML (synced with LDAP) test.one @mattermost.com (OKTA, Jumpcloud)
2. Delete user from OKTA
3. Create new user with that same email address and username
4. Log in to Mm using SAML

**Expected**

- User can see the "old" account's history (is logged in on the existing account)
