## MM-T2738: user is added to channel and team because of newly linked group and channel syncable.

---

**Step 1**

user is added to channel and team because of newly linked group and channel syncable.\
————————————————————————————\
1\. User already exists in group and Mm; group is not linked to any team or channel\
2\. Admin newly configures a group and links to a team\
3\. Admin then selects via the channel list a channel on that same team to link\
4\. User is not added to the team immediately\
5\. Admin syncs AD/LDAP

**Expected**

User is added to the newly linked team / channel on sync
