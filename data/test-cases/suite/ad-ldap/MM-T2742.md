## MM-T2742: What about LDAP / SAML sync?

---

**Step 1**

What about LDAP / SAML sync?\
————————————————————————————\
1\. User does not yet exist in Mattermost, but they exist in both SAML and LDAP, with same email address in each, and differing name info\
2\. Create account in Mattermost using SAML (tested on OKTA)\
3\. Ensure SAML/LDAP sync is NOT enabled\
4\. Sync LDAP, no change to the SAML user, no linked teams/channels added\
5\. Enable SAML/LDAP sync\
6\. Ensure that the group the SAML user is in has at least one linked team/channel (that they're not currently part of)\
7\. Sync LDAP

**Expected**

User's name is from LDAP, not SAML\
\
User has been added to team/channel that was llinked to their group\
