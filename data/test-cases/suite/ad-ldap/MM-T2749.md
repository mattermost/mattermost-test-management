---

**Step 1**

Upon being removed from nested linked LDAP group user has MM membership removed.\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Identify a user in an LDAP group that is a member of (nested in) another group, both of which have linked team/channel(s)\
2\. In LDAP, remove that user from the LDAP group\
3\. Admin sync LDAP

**Expected**

No auto-removal from Mm team/channel\
User no longer appears in the user list on that Group's page in Mm and also in the user list on the Group that it's a member of (nested in)
