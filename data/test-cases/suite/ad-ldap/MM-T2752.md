---

**Step 1**

User who had been in a linked LDAP group is added back in LDAP (after having been removed)\
————————————————————————————\
^ user is deactivated in LDAP\
and then reactivated via LDAP,\
and part of a linked group (and also not),\
will their teams/channels memberships still be available?
