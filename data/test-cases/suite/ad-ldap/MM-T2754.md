---

**Step 1**

Group name changed in LDAP, is reflected in Mattermost, config remains the same and still works as expected\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Identify an LDAP group that is linked to team/channel in Mm\
2\. In LDAP, change the group name (for now, display name mapped to common name; in future, other attributes could be mapped to display name)\
3\. Admin sync

**Expected**

Group page shows updated name\
\
All configured links are preserved
