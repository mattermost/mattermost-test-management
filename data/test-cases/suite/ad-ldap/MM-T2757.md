## MM-T2757: SAML / LDAP sync off then on + sync

---

**Step 1**

SAML / LDAP sync off then on + sync\
————————————————————————————\
1\) Disable SAML sync with LDAP\
2\) Ensure there are group(s) linked with team/channel(s)\
3\) Login for the first time as SAML user who also has LDAP account under the same email address: user should get no channels or teams\
4\) Sync: user should get no channels or teams.\
5\) Enable ldap sync, sync: user should get channels and teams.

**Expected**

SAML user who also exists in LDAP should not get LDAP groups if SAML / LDAP sync is off
