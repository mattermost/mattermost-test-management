## MM-T2758: SAML / LDAP on for first time login, then sync off, user removed from group on LDAP side, then sync back on

---

**Step 1**

SAML / LDAP on for first time login, then sync off, user removed from group on LDAP side, then sync back on\
————————————————————————————\
1\) Enable SAML sync with LDAP.\
2\) Upon first login user should get teams and channels.\
3\) Disable SAML sync with LDAP.\
4\) Remove user from LDAP group.\
5\) Sync: user should remain in MM group.\
6\) Enable SAML sync with LDAP, sync: user should be removed from group (but not auto-removed from team/channels)

**Expected**

SAML user who also exists in LDAP should remain in Group on Mm side with SAML sync off, then is removed with SAML sync on
