## MM-T2762: Check if LDAP Sync updates user records every time

---

**Step 1**

Check if LDAP Sync updates user records every time\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Configure LDAP Settings and login with couple of LDAP users.\
2\. Now change the LDAP Settings entries for Last Name Attribute (which is default sn) and set it as name and perform LDAP Group Sync.\
3\. Check if LDAP Sync details shows the number of users updated.\
4\. Without any changes, click on the LDAP Group Sync again and check if this time, it does not shows the number of users updated.

[LDAP Sync updates all user records everytime it runs if certain parameters are removed — MM-22761](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-22761)

**Expected**

3\. LDAP Sync details should only show the number of users updated only when there were really some changes which had affected the users.\
4\. If there are no changes, LDAP Sync details should not show `Updated 2 users`
