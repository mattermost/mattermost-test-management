## MM-T2771: Setup

---

**Step 1**

Setup\
————————————————————————————

1. Create team Constrain-Dev, link it to Developers group, then CLI to group constrain the team
2. Create team Constrain-QA, then create private channel LDAP-QA-channel, link it to QA group, then CLI to group constrain the channel

**Expected**

- During first test, I set the QA team to be open, to see what happens
