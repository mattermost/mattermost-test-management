## MM-T2778: Shouldn't see Manage Members in channel drop-down

---

**Step 1**

Shouldn't see Manage Members in channel drop-down\
————————————————————————————\
(right?)\
\
Note: False alarms due to my temporary confusion (these are all expected, as a member of a constrained team could leave / be added to, say, Off-Topic on that team):\
3\. Constrained team: Off-Topic link at top of channel `Invite others to this channel` ➜ Add new members modal\
4\. Constrained team: Off-Topic channel drop-down has Add Members and Manage Members\
5\. Constrained team: Off-Topic member icon drop-down has Manage Members

**Expected**

ASK MARTIN:\
Seeing some member management that perhaps shouldn't be visible? Only visible when that user would normally have permissions in a non-constrained channel/team. But still, can't actually add or remove; just strange to see some Manage Members options visible in menus:\
1\. Constrained channel: channel drop-down ➜ Manage Members ➜ Add Members (no one available to add, but the options are there to click through)\
2\. Constrained channel: member icon drop-down ➜ Manage Members ➜ Add Members (no one available to add, but the options are there to click through)\
3\. Constrained team: Main Menu ➜ Manage Members (should say View Members?)
