A. Remove a user from a group...\
1\. User gets removed from associated group-constrained channels\

————————————————————————————

1. Associate QA team with abc group
2. Associate Constrain-QA-Channel with abc group

5. In LDAP instance, remove jesse.test from abc group

(**Story**) [Update LDAP sync job to delete memberships from teams and channels — MM-14412](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14422)

**Expected**

jesse.test is removed from both

- Still on the parent team that was not group-constrained, but removed from its group-constrained private channel
- Removed entirely from QA team

**Note in first test**: jesse.test starts with just engineering team and william.test channel
