## MM-T2789: LDAP sync job deletes memberships from teams and channels C. Group gets disassociated from a... 1. Channel, all group members are removed from the channel 2. Team, all group members are removed from the team

---

**Step 1**

LDAP sync job deletes memberships from teams and channels\
C. Group gets disassociated from a...\
1\. Channel, all group members are removed from the channel\
2\. Team, all group members are removed from the team\
————————————————————————————

1. Remove Constrain-Dev team from developers group ➜ william.test and george.test removed after sync
2. Remove Constrain-QA-Channel from xyz group ➜ george.test is removed after sync

Note that this also tests with nested groups, since george.test is member of xyz and xyz group is member of developers group
