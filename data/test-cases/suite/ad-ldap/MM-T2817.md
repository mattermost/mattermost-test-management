## MM-T2817: Don't remove bots from teams and channels when doing LDAP groups removals

---

**Step 1**

Don't remove bots from teams and channels when doing LDAP groups removals\
————————————————————————————\
Add a bot to a group-constrained team or channel and ensure that, while other user accounts are removed from the team or channel, bot accounts do not get removed.

1. Create bot account (enable bot accounts in System Console ➜ Integrations ➜ Features, then create bot account in main menu ➜ Integrations)
2. Create a private channel
3. Add the bot account to the private channel (channel drop-down ➜ Add Members to Channel, or use the link in the channel intro text)
4. Also add another user to the private channel who is not in the LDAP group you're going to link it to
5. System admin link an LDAP group to the channel (can sync LDAP here if curious who is added; no one would be removed b/c not constrained yet)
6. In CLI, enable group-constraint for the channel
7. Verify before LDAP sync that users including the bot were not removed
8. Sync LDAP

(**Story**) [Don't remove bots from teams and channels when doing LDAP groups removals — MM-15261](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15261)

**Expected**

- Other user you added (step 4) was removed from the channel
- Bot account is still in the channel

**Summary**: Users in the group are added / remain in the channel. Users not in the group are removed from the channel, except for bot accounts. They stay even though they're not in an LDAP group
