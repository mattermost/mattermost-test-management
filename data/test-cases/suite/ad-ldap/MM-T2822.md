## MM-T2822: Change/Remove LDAP Admin Filter

---

**Step 1**

Change/Remove LDAP Admin Filter\
————————————————————————————

1. Ensure LDAP setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Navigate to System Console ➜ AD/LDAP and set Admin Filter to "(givenName=barrett)"
3. Login as a LDAP user who has this attribute "(givenName=barrett)" configured in the AD/LDAP Server
4. Now login as sysadmin and set Enable Admin Attribute to false and check

**Expected**

- Existing LDAP System Admin users should not be demoted to members.
- Any new LDAP user who tries to login with "givenName=barrett" will no longer be considered a System Admin user and instead should be considered a regular member
