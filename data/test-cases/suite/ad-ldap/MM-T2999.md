## MM-T2999: LDAP Sync job should not fail if Team settings has email restrictions

---

**Step 1**

1\. Create a new Team and ensure team settings has the email domain restriction enabled to "mattermost.org"\
2\. From System Console > navigate to the Teams page, select the new team and add a LDAP Group which has members in it and their email domain does not contains mattermost.org\
3\. Visit System Console > AD/LDAP Configuration page and perform a LDAP Group Sync.

**Expected**

LDAP Group Sync should be completed without any errors.
