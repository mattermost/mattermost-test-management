---

**Step 1**

Multi-factor Authentication\
(AD/LDAP) - Enter mixed-case email address at login\
————————————————————————————

1. Ensure MFA is enabled on the server, and activated for an LDAP account
2. On login page, enter the email address associated with the AD/LDAP account, but ensure that you use mixed case (such as `test.ONE\@mattermost.com`), and then the correct password
3. When prompted, enter the correct MFA code

**Expected**

- Login is successful after entering the MFA code, even when email address was entered with mixed case.
