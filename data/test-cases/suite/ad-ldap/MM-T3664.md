## MM-T3664: SAML User, Not in LDAP

---

**Step 1**

With SAML enabled to sync with LDAP, user exists in SAML but that email address doesn't have an active LDAP account:\
\- Can create new in SAML that doesn't exist yet in LDAP (if there's room in LDAP to add that user there later)\
\- OR can use an existing account but before starting, in Jumpcloud remove the user from all Groups and then from the Jumpcloud Directory (effectively disabling them; the Suspend function in Jumpcloud might not work for this)\
\
First: Admin ensure SAML is enabled to sync with LDAP, then in another browser (make sure not still logged into OKTA in other browser as previous test.one):\
1\. User who has a SAML account but not an (active) LDAP account clicks the OKTA signin button and creates account in Mattermost using SAML\
2\. System admin syncs LDAP\
3\. User is auto-logged-out. They show as inactive in System Console > Users (They can log back in again using SAML, but they will be deactivated again on any subsequent LDAP sync)\
4\. System admin re-activates or adds them in LDAP (be sure to use same email address as in SAML, and be sure that they are selected as active in Groups > `All Users - LDAP` in Jumpcloud)\
5\. If necessary: User completes LDAP account activation\
6\. User logs back in to Mattermost using SAML and they are successfully reactivated, and exhibit attributes from OKTA\
7\. System admin syncs LDAP\
8\. User is not logged out / deactivated, and shows attributes from LDAP

**Expected**

After last step, user is not logged out / deactivated, and shows attributes from LDAP
