## MM-T3665: Deactivate user in SAML, do not delete in LDAP

---

**Step 1**

In OKTA, can use the Suspend option on the user.

**Expected**

â€“ User is not auto-logged-out, but if they log out of Mm, they can't log back in using SAML: sees signin error (Sign-in failed!) on OKTA credentials page\
\
\- Reactivate user after this test is done
