## MM-T3666: SAML/LDAP sync with ID Attribute

---

**Step 1**

Summary of all of the test steps\
\
(This covers failure and success cases from below)" "rc.test.mattermost.com:\
In OKTA: Applications > rc.test > General > Attributes (idAttr already set up with user.firstName)\
In Mm: SAML > Override SAML bind data with AD/LDAP information: true\
In Mm: SAML > ID Attribute = idAttr (in OneLogin I did FirstName)\
In Mm: Log in using OKTA or create new Mm account using OKTA, with an account that has a different first name in OKTA vs. user ID (uid) in LDAP\
In Mm: Sync LDAP\
OKTA user log out and try to log back in using OKTA > Error ""This account does not use SAML authentication. Please sign in using email and password"" or ""An account with that username already exists. Please contact your Administrator""\
In OKTA: Change first name to match Jumpcloud uid such as ""test.two""\
Back to Mattermost, try to log in again > Success, user info from OKTA, with first name the same as the LDAP username such as ""test.two""\
Sync LDAP\
OKTA user refresh > user info from LDAP\
In Mm SAML: Remove idAttr and disable SAML override on SAML page\
In OKTA: Change OKTA user's first name back so it doesn't match LDAP uid\
OKTA user log out and back in using SAML > Error as before (expected that admin would then have to go in and delete all the accounts to make room for the new person, rather than the new person inadvertently accessing the ""old"" account)\
\
Cleanup:\
Admin change the OKTA account in Mm to email/password, then that user log in to Mm and change email & username

_Important notes about this step:_

Notes for context: SAML / LDAP sync with ID Attribute set (summary of what brought on this feature)\
\
The originating test case is:\
1\. User exists, can log in with SAML and LDAP sync\
2\. User leaves the company (for example)\
3\. A new person arrives at the company with the same name, and by convention is assigned the same email address and username as the former employee\
4\. Without using the ID Attribute, even if the admin deletes the old and creates a new account for this user in SAML / LDAP, if nothing was done to change the user in Mattermost, the new user will log in and see all of the old user's history (because they have the same username / email address in Mattermost)\
5\. With the ID Attribute in use, each SAML account gets an ID Attribute that is used to verify the user's identity in Mattermost (overriding the user of email address to identify the user), so the new user will not be able to sign in using the new SAML account; they will see an error saying there is already an account with that username. At that point, they can alert their system admin, who can then go into Mattermost and remove the colliding username/email address, and then the new user will be able to log in and they will have a fresh, new Mattermost account
