## MM-T5517: System console user list shows that deactivate option is not available for LDAP users

---

**Step 1**

1. Login as an Admin and locate a user that is managed by LDAP
2. In the system console navigate to _Users_ and locate the user on the list
3. Select the _Member_ drop down

**Expected**

The Deactivate option is grayed out and there is text below explaining that the user is "Managed by LDAP"
