**Step 1**

Ref: <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-48186>

Steps:

1. Login as two LDAP users (userA and userB) in an LDAP group.
2. Configure the group to sync to a team and a channel.
3. Have both users leave the channel and the team.
4. Go to **System Console** > **Users**, go to **userA**, and from the drop down menu select **Reset group-defaulted teams and channels**.

**Expected**

step 2: the users should get added to the team and then channel.
step 4: **userA** should be re-added to the team and the channel and **userB** should not get re-added to the team or the channel.
