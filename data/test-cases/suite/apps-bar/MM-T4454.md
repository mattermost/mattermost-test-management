## MM-T4454: Feature flag works to enable the app bar

---

**Step 1**

1\. Start your server with the Feature Flag for the Apps Bar in a True state `_MM\_FEATUREFLAGS\_AppBarEnabled=false_`\
2\. Deploy a build of the Playbooks Plugin that has been retrofitted to use the Apps Bar instead of the channel header\
3\. Enable the Playbooks plugin

**Expected**

\- The Apps bar is visible on the right hand side\
\- The Playbooks plugin is shown in the Apps bar
