## MM-T4847: Plugins with App Bar components display correct icon set in the App Bar

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable App Bar on your Mattermost server\
2\. Install and enable plugins that have had the icon migrated to the App Bar component (recent Focal Board and Playbooks or ToDo v0.6.0)

**Expected**

\- New colored Icons show in app bar\
\- Icons look good in all themes\
\- Icons are all functional and show visual feedback when clicked
