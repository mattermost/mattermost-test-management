## MM-T4851: App Bar can be disabled moving all plugins back to the channel header

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable App Bar on your Mattermost server\
2\. Install and enable multiple plugins and apps (icluding ones without migraded icons)\
3\. Disable the app bar in client setup

**Expected**

All icons fail over to the channel header when App Bar is disabled
