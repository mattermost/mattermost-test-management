## MM-T1764: Security - Signup: Email verification required (after having created account when verification was not required)

---

**Step 1**

Security - Signup: Email verification required (after having created account when verification was not required)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Email ➜ "Require Email Verification" = false

2. Save

3. If needed, set System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Signup ➜ `Enable open server` to true, then create a new account on another browser/device (use a valid email address you have access to)

4. Verify you are brought directly to team selection page / tutorial / Town Square (depending on signup method and settings)

5. System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ Email ➜ "Require Email Verification" = true

6. Save

7. New user log out and back in. Log in using {username} rather than email address, if username is enabled for login (otherwise email is fine)

8. See Almost Done page, click `Resend email`, see green success message "Verification email sent."

9. Check your email, click in the email message to verify your email address, then log in

   1. Verify you are able to log in successfully

**Expected**

After entering credentials in step 8, page displays:\
**Mattermost**: You are almost done\
Please verify your email address. Check your inbox for an email.\
\[Resend email] button\
\
Resend email button sends verification email to your email address (so two verification messages total were received), and after verifying email you can log in
