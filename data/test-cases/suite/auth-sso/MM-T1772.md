## MM-T1772: Change minimum password length, verify help text and error message

---

**Step 1**

Minimum password Length\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Set "Minimum password Length" to 7\
2\. Save

**Expected**

Save successful, verify the error message appears correctly when resetting password or creating a new account if created with a password less than 7 characters. Verify that the error message preview updates live as you make changes to the minimum password length (is this one for creating a new account? what does "live" mean? works on refresh. AHA, this is the error message preview that appears when pwd requirements are selected. so do requirements tests first / along with this test).
