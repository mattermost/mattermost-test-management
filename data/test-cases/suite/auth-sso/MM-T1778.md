## MM-T1778: MFA - Enforced forces user to set up MFA after logging out and trying to log back in

---

**Step 1**

MFA - Enforced\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**First**: Ensure you already have MFA set up on a separate \*\*system admin\*\* account on the server, in case an issue arises and you need to get back in to System Console to disable MFA enforcement.

1. In a separate browser, log in a user \*other than\* the system admin you're going to use to change the settings
2. Ensure the system admin you're using to change the setting has MFA set up, and can use it to log in
3. System admin: Enable MFA enforcement in System Console ➜ MFA
4. Observe the other account in the other browser immediately sees the MFA setup page
5. Have the other user click in the top left to log out
6. Have the other user enter email/password to sign in
7. Observe the other user sees the MFA setup page
8. Be sure to remove enforcement after this test

**Expected**

- MFA enforcement is applied immediately, requiring users without it set up to set it up
- Check System Console>> Users and ensure that Remove MFA option does not appear for users who have not setup MFA yet.
- Don't forget to REMOVE enforcement after this test is done
