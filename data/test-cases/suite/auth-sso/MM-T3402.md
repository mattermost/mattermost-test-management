## MM-T3402: Login on one tab takes effect on additional tab on that browser

---

**Step 1**

Login - multiple tabs\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Open 2 tabs with the same server on the same browser e.g. rc.test.mattermost.com on Chrome - leave both on login screen
2. Log in on one tab
3. Click on the second tab

**Expected**

- Login is signaled to other tabs
- Login on other tabs completes when focus is placed on those tabs and not immediately at the time of initial login at step 2.
