## MM-T1565: 03 - Create a channel

**Precondition**

A team should already have been created and users must be added to the team.

---

**Step 1**

Run `./mattermost channel create --team ateam --name mynewchannel --display\_name "My New Channel"`

**Expected**

1. Output in CLI should look similar to:
   \
   `Id: z5iknrxz97nstn6h7dukhqi6gw\ Name: mynewchannel\ Display Name: My New Channel`
2. Admin viewing the new team clicks "More..." under Public Channels and sees "My New Channel" (Don't joint it!)

---

**Step 2**

Run `./mattermost channel create --team ateam --name mynewprivatechannel --display\_name "My New Private Channel" --private`

**Expected**

Output in CLI should look similar to:\
`Id: 8yx9xgne8pdf5xm5ooij43fckw\ Name: mynewprivatechannel\ Display Name: My New Private Channel`\
(Private channel will be verified in following test, when admin user is added to it)
