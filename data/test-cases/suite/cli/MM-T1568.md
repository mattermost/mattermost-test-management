## MM-T1568: 06 - Archive a channel

**Precondition**

A channel must already have been created in a known team.

---

**Step 1**

1. Have admin view My New Private Channel.
2. Run `./mattermost channel archive ateam:mynewprivatechannel`

_Important notes about this step:_

Channel disappears on refresh. Ticket for mobile failure - <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19961>

**Expected**

1. admin refreshes and is viewing Town Square; archived channel is not in LHS
2. Running _`./mattermost channel list ateam`_ should show \_mynewprivatechannel (archived) (private) \_\_\_
3. In some tests channel has archive icon in LHS, message box is disabled, "You are viewing an archived channel. New messages cannot be posted." appears
