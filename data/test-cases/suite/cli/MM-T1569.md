## MM-T1569: 07 - Deactivate a user

**Precondition**

An active member must have been added to the test team.

**Step 1**

Run _`./mattermost user deactivate test7\@test.com`_\
\
(If needed can reactivate and then deactivate or vice-versa. Activate command: ./bin/mattermost user activate test7\@test.com)

**Expected**

Upon refreshing, admin presses CTRL/CMD+K, finds test7, the deactivated user is not listed in search result (If deactivated user logs out and tries to log back in, fails with "Login failed because your account has been deactivated. Please contact an administrator. ") Then admin go to System Console > Users and reactivate test7
