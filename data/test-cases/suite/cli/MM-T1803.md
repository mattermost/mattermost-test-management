## MM-T1803: Replies should be imported correctly for bulk imports

**Objective**

To verify that replies are imported correctly during bulk import

**Precondition**

A sample bulk import json file is needed. CLI or MMCTL access is needed.

---

**Step 1**

1. Run the following CLI command in server: `bin/mattermost import bulk \<bulk-import.json> --apply`. The bulk-import file can be stored anywhere, and the file path can be used in the cli command.
2. Once the import is completed, find the new team that's created by the import and find the test channel.
3. Verify that messages and replies are imported correctly on the center channel view.
4. Verify that messages and replies appear correctly on reply threads.
