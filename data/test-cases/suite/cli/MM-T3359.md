–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Make sure that the setting in System console > Environment > File Storage > Local Storage Directory is set to some directory other than ./data
2. Create at least a new custom emoji and make sure that it was saved in the directory specified before.
3. Run the bulk export command

**Expected**

- Verify that the command finishes without error and that the emoji is at its correct location.
