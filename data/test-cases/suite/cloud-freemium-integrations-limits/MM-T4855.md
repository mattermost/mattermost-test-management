## MM-T4855: Crashed plugin counts as enabled

---

**Step 1**

1\. Setup a server where the integration limits are being enforced\
2\. Install and enable 4 non-core plugins that count towards the limit and enable them all\
3\. Install a 5th plugin that is not core and can be misconfigured (Zoom for example)\
4\. Enable the misconfigured plugin\
5\. Install an additional non-core plugin\
6\. Attempt to enable the plugin

**Expected**

On 4. The plugin will crash due to missing configuration.\
On 6. The server is already at the plugin limit even though a plugin is in a crashed state
