---

**Step 1**

1\. Install adb (Android Studio)\
2\. Connect Android device to your computer and ensure device is visible: In Terminal run\
adb devices\
3\. Download APK to the computer\
4\. Get ID of managed user by running in Terminal:\
adb shell pm list users\
Example: If `UserInfo{11:Sample Managed Profile:30} running` is returned, then ID is `11`\
5\. In Terminal run\
adb install -r --user 11\
Where `11` is the user ID you found in step 4, and is the path to the file on your computer\
6\. You may need to tap in an approval message on the Android device to continue installation

**Expected**

App is installed in the managed workspace (app icon shows the little briefcase icon)
