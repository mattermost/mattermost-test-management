---

**Step 1**

On Android (should be device owner; if not use emulator)\
1\. Uninstall Mattermost\
2\. Install Test DPC: https\://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc\&hl=en\
3\. Tap Set Up Test DPC (not just "Test DPC")\
4\. Set up managed profile > Accept > Add account > Add Google Apps account (use your usual Mattermost one that you use in Play Store, authenticate as needed), Agree to TOS > Finish\
5\. Tap the Play Store icon that has the briefcase badge (may find it in a separate Work apps list)\
6\. Search for Mattermost, install\
7\. Back out of Play Store\
8\. Tap the Test DPC icon that has the briefcase badge\
9\. Scroll to the Apps Management section and tap Managed Configurations\
10\. Select Mattermost from the drop-down list of apps\
11\. Tap Load Manifest Restrictions\
12\. Tap pencil icon next to the restriction you want to edit (in this case `timeout`; can test a bunch at once)\
13\. Type in a significantly lower timeout value (e.g. 10)\
14\. Save, then Save again\
15\. From the device's list of apps, find and tap the Mattermost icon that has a briefcase badge\
16\. Try to connect to a server\
\
Note: For APKs that you install not via Playstore, make sure they are installed in the Work tab (not in Personal tab)

**Expected**

After #16,

- User should not be able to connect since it is timing out
