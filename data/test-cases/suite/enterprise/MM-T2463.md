2\. Navigate to System Console > Groups page and enable Group Mention for a group.\
3\. Clear the Group Mention field and try to save.\
4\. Specify the Group Mention name as "testing#123" and try to save.\
5\. Specify the Group mention name as a name which already exists and try to save.\
6\. Specify the Group mention name as "Testing" and check if no errors are displayed.

4\. An error "Only letters (a-z), numbers(0-9), periods, dashes and underscores are allowed." should be displayed.\
5\. An error "Group mention is already taken." should be displayed.\
6\. Group name should be converted to lowercase and be saved as "testing"
