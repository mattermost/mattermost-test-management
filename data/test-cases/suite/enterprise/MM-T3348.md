## MM-T3348: Convert to private channel should only be shown to users with permission

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as sysadmin and visit System Console > Permissions page.\
2\. Verify if there is a new permission added to "Convert channels" under "Manage Public Channels". This permission should not be present for "Manage Private Channels".\
3\. By default, the permission should only be enabled for Team Admins and System Admin.\
4\. Uncheck the "Convert Channels" option for Team Admin and login as Team Admin and check if Team Admin is allowed to convert a public channel to private channel.\
5\. Check the "Convert Channels" option for All Members and save. Login as a regular member and check if the user is allowed to convert a public channel to private channel.

**Expected**

2\. "Convert channels" option should be present under "Manage Public Channels" and should not be present under "Manage Private Channels"\
\
3\. By default, only Team Admins & System Admins should have this option enabled.\
\
4\. Team Admin should not be allowed to convert public channel to private if the permission is not granted\
\
5\. Regular member should be allowed to convert public channel to private if the permission is granted.
