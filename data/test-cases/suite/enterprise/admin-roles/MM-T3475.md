Change Permissions - Admin Roles - Read Only

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as Sysadmin and visit System Console > System Roles page.\
2\. Click on Read Only Role and set the following new permissions and save:\\

- User Management > Users - Read + Write
- Site Configuration > Read + Write
- Authentication > Read + Write
- Environment > None

3\. Login as the system\_read\_only\_admin and visit System Console.\
4\. Check if the user has the following permissions in different screens:\
\\

|                         |                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| User Management > Users | **Read + Write** |
| Site Configuration      | **Read + Write** |
| Authentication          | **Read + Write** |
| Environment             | **None**         |

**Expected**

User should be able to access the different screens as per the permissions defined in the test. Here is the brief of these permissions:\
\
**None** - User should not be able to view the screen\
\
**Read** - User should be able to only view the data in that screen. User should not be able to modify anything\
\
**Read+Write** - User should be allowed to view and modify the data in the corresponding screen. User should not receive any error when data is modified and saved.
