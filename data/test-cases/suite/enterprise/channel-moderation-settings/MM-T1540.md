**Step 2**

1. Modify different configurations, save, reload the page & check if the values are persisted.

**Expected**

- The configurations should be saved and persisted even after reload.

---

**Step 3**

1. Make some changes and do not save and then click on some other page. A message should be prompted that changes have not been saved and will be discarded. Click on Discard.

**Expected**

- If the changes are made and user does not saves, a message should be displayed to the user that the changes have not been saved and will be discarded. If user confirms the discard, the changes should not persist.
