3\. Option to allow Channel Mentions for Guests should also be disabled when Create Post option is disabled. A message "Guests can not use channel mentions without the ability to create posts" should be displayed.\

If both Guests & Members are disabled, then the message should read like:\
"Guests & Members can not use channel mentions without the ability to create posts"
