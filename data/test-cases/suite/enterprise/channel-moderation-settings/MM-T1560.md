## MM-T1560: Effect of changing System Schemes on a Channel for which Channel Moderation Settings was never modified

**Objective**

Effect of changing System Schemes on a Channel for which Channel Moderation Settings was never modified

**Precondition**

None

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as sysadmin and Edit the System Scheme and remove the option to use Manage Members for Members & Save.\
5\. Visit the Channels page and click on a channel (which was not modified before).\
6\. Check if the option to allow Manage Members for Members should be disabled.\
7\. Login as a Regular Member and visit the same channel.\
8\. Check if the user has the permission to add or remove people in the channel.

- (**Story**) [Add E2E tests + Unit tests for Channel Moderation Widget — MM-23102](http://mmthttps%3A//mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23102)

**Expected**

Any changes to System Scheme should also be propagated down to Channel Moderation Settings for individual channels.\
6\. Hence the option to allow Manage Members for Members should also be disabled in Channel Moderation Settings when changed in System Scheme.\
8\. Regular Member should not be able to add or remove people in the channel when its removed from the System Scheme.
