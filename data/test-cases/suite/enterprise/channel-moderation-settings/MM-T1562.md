5\. Visit the Channels page and click on the same channel (as used in step 2).\

Any changes to the Team Override Scheme should also be propagated down to Channel Moderation Settings for individual channels.\
6\. Hence the option to allow Manage Members for Members should also be disabled in Channel Moderation Settings when changed in Team Override Scheme.\
8\. Regular Member should not be able to add or remove people in the channel when its removed from the Team Override Scheme.
