## MM-T2457: Group Mentions when group members are not in the team and the channel

**Objective**

Check Group Mentions when group members are not in the team and the channel

**Precondition**

None

---

**Step 1**

1\. Enable Group Mention for a group say Group1.\
2\. As a regular member, create a new team and ensure no members of Group1 are present in the team.\
3\. Now submit a post containing the group mention Group1.\
4\. The user should get a system message indicating that "@Group1 has no members on this team". None of the members of group1 should be notified. The group mention should not be highlighted.

**Expected**

Group Mentions when group members are not in the team and the channel should be working fine as expected
