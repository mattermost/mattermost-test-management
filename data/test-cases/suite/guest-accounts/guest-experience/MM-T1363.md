## MM-T1363: Verify Team Members Dialog

---

**Step 1**

1. Login as a Guest User who has access to only one team and one channel say Channel
2. Ensure that a User say User2 is part of same team but different channel say Channel2
3. Click on View Members from the dropdown next to the channel name and check out the list of all users displayed
4. Also verify the count of users displayed on the Team Members dialog

_Related ticket(s):_

[Guest Accounts: Count of Team Members is not displayed correctly for a Guest User in the View Members Popup â€” MM-17218](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17218)

**Expected**

- Guest User should be able to view only the users who are part of Channel1 and should not see User2
- The count of users displayed in the Team Members dialog should be correct and should match the number of users displayed in the list.
