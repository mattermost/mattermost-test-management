## MM-T1366: Guest User Permission Schemes

---

**Step 1**

1. Login to application as a guest user and send a Direct message.
2. Check if guest user is allowed to edit (or) delete their own message
3. Check if guest user is allowed to create new channels
4. Repeat the above steps and check the same in Group Message, Channels

**Expected**

- Guest Users should not be allowed to edit/delete their own message since this option is by default restricted in the System Console -> Permission Schemes
- Guest Users should not be allowed to create new channels since this option is by default restricted in the System Console -> Permission Schemes
