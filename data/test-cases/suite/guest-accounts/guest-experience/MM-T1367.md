[(RN) Guest Accounts: "Jump to" lists users that no longer share any channels with the guest — MM-19978](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19978)

**Expected**

- Guest users should not be able to search and view other users who are not part of the same channel as Guest User.
- In this case, Guest user should not be able to search and view User2
- No errors and no infinite loading icon should be shown while searching for users in the Switch Channels dialog.
