## MM-T3644: Guest > Leave team modal help text

---

**Step 1**

Guest - Leave any team, Public or Private (message is the same regardless)\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Add a Guest user to either Public or Private Team
2. Invite the Guest user to few public and private channels
3. As Guest user: Login and Click on main menu>Leave Team
4. Verify Leave Team modal text:
   \
   **You will be removed from \[#] public channels and \[#] private channels on this team.** You won't be able to rejoin it without an invitation from another team member. Are you sure?
5. Select Yes

**Test Data**

Example:\

**Expected**

- If Guest belongs to more teams, they are taken to other team
- Guest user does not see a list of teams to join if they only belong to one team on the server, instead they see a message "Your guest account has no channels assigned. Please contact an administrator." and an option to logout
