4. Navigate to the main page and click on Invite People from the main menu.
5. Check if only the option to Invite Members is shown and the option to Invite Guests is not shown.

- Only the option to Invite Members should be shown. The option to Invite Guests should not be shown to the user when 'Enable Guest Access' is turned off.
