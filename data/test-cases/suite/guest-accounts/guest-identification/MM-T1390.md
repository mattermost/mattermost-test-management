---

**Step 1**

Enforce Guest MFA when MFA is enabled and enforced\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log in as a team admin and navigate to System Console -> Authentication ➜ MFA Page
2. Ensure the setting 'Enable Multi factor authentication' is set to true in the MFA page.
3. Also ensure that this MFA setting is enforced.
4. Now navigate to Guest Access page and check if user is allowed to enforce MFA for Guest
5. Enable MFA for Guest Access and save.
6. From the main page, invite a Guest user and click on the Join Team in the email sent to the guest user.
7. Create an account with Email and Password and check if user is enforced to configure MFA.

**Expected**

- When MFA is enforced for Guest Access, guest user should be forced to configure MFA while creating an account
