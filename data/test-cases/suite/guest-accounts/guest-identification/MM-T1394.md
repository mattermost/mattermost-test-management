## MM-T1394: Manage Users - Change Email not whitelisted for Guest user

---

**Step 1**

Manage Users - Change Email not whitelisted for Guest user\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Login to the application and click on Invite People and invite few guests. Accept all the invitations and ensure there are different guest users in the system.
2. Now Log in as a team admin and navigate to System Console ➜ Guest Access Page.
3. Add a domain in whitelisted domain section.
4. Now navigate to users page and select a Guest User and click on Change Email.
5. Try to enter an email which does not belongs to the whitelisted domain and check if Admin is allowed to enter an email which is not whitelisted.

**Expected**

- Admin should not be allowed to enter an email for a Guest User which does not matches the whitelisted domain. An error should be shown to the Admin and this option should be restricted from the System console.
