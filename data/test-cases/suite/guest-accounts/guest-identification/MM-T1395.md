- That user should be shown as a Guest User in the Manage Team popup and not as a Team Member.
- Guest dropdown should only show options to Promote to User and Remove from Team.
- Admin should be able to promote a Guest User to a Regular member from the Manage Team popup.
- Admin should be able to remove a team for a Guest User. The logged in Guest user should be automatically redirected to one of the other teams which that guest user has access to.
- When all Teams are removed for a Guest User and the guest users is logged in (or) logs in, the user should be deactivated, logged out and redirected to the login page with an error message indicating that the user's account has been deactivated. Please contact the administrator.
