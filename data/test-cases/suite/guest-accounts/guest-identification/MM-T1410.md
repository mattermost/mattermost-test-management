(**Story**) [Confirmation Modal when Guest feature is disabled — MM-18443](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18443)

**Expected**

- A confirmation modal with text "_Disabling guest access will revoke all current Guest Account sessions. Guests will no longer be able to login and new guests cannot be invited into Mattermost. Guest users will be marked as inactive in user lists. Enabling this feature will not reinstate previous guest accounts._"
- Option to invite guest users should not be displayed
