## MM-T1417: Add Guest User to New Team from System Console

---

**Step 1**

Add Guest User to New Team from System Console\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As a system admin, add a guest user to a new team from User Management ➜ User ➜Add to team.
2. Login as the guest user and navigate to the new team(if your guest is in more than one team)
3. Notice the guest user will be redirected to the channel not found error. A back button should be provided in this error page.
4. When user clicks on the back button link, the guest user should be redirected to the original team/channel to which the user has access to.

_Related ticket(s):_

- [When adding a guest to a team from the user management page the Guest is put into a channel not found page and unable to log out or request help — MM-19303](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19303)
- Improvement ticket created for the issues raised in the ticket above: [\[Design\] Prevent System Admins from adding a Guest to a team in System Console > Users > Add Team — MM-20207](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-20207)

_Important notes about this step:_

MM-20207 was created to address the issues raised in MM-19303 which although closed and tied to v5.18 on the ticket was never actually fixed.

**Expected**

- User should be redirected to an error page containing the message "Your guest account has no channels assigned. Please contact an administrator."
- When user clicks on Back button, user should be redirected to the previous team/channel to which the user had access to.
