## MM-T1423: SAML Guest Attribute behavior when Guest Access is disabled

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure SAML setup is done correctly on an instance
2. Ensure Guest Access is turned on in System Console > Guest Access.
3. Navigate to System Console > SAML 2.0 and set Guest Attribute to "isGuest=true".
4. Now navigate to System Console > Guest Access and disable the Guest Access.
5. Check if the option to set Guest Attribute is also disabled in System Console > SAML 2.0 page

[Guest Filter and Guest Attributes should be disabled/hidden in the LDAP and SAML settings when Guest Access is disabled — MM-20866](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-20866)

**Expected**

- Option to set Guest Attribute should be disabled in SAML 2.0 page when Guest Access is disabled.

---

**Step 2**

1. Login as a new SAML user with matching attribute isGuest set to true.
2. The User should be allowed to login as a regular member

**Expected**

- New SAML user logged in with matching the guest attribute should be ignored and should be considered as a regular member and should be allowed to access the rest of the application.
