## MM-T2583: UI: Search groups incl. pagination

---

**Step 1**

UI: Search groups incl. pagination\
————————————————————————————\
(I set up Jumpcloud so it has >200 groups, and enough to paginate when searching on `filter`)

1. Load Groups page with an LDAP instance that has over 200 groups that will appear in the same search results, and more over that that won't show up in that search
2. Scroll down, observe count 1-200 of XXX
3. Click right arrow to view page 2
4. Observe page 2 count, for example, `201-269 of 269`
5. Click left arrow to return to page 1 (also works to enter search term from this page)
6. Enter `filter` in the search box and press Enter (this is the search term that should return >200 results)
7. Scroll down, observing results all contain `filter` and are in alpha order
8. At bottom, observe count such as `1-200 of 207`
9. Click right arrow to view page 2 of search results
10. Scroll down, observing results all contain `filter`
11. 1Count at bottom, such as `201-207 of 207`

**Expected**

- Also:

  - Cleared search using backspace or `x` and verified all groups returned
  - Smaller search terms
  - Term returning no results (`No groups found`)
  - Search from page two
  - Is Linked (and plus text string)
  - Is Not Linked (and plus text string)
  - Is Not Linked + Is Configured (no results)
  - Is Configured (and plus text string)
  - Various combos of linked/not linked + configured/not configured
