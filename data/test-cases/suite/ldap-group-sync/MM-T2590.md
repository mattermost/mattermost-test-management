## MM-T2590: Admin links a team; new user in that group logs in and is added to team (Nested group)

---

**Step 1**

Admin links a team; new user in that group logs in and is added to team\
(Nested group)\
————————————————————————————\
This example links a group that is a member of another linked group\
\
sysadmin links qa group to qa team (no channel specified)\
engineering group should also be linked to engineering team\
lindy.test logs in for the first time (note that if using SAML / LDAP sync you will need to have OKTA open in another tab to log out there too or it will keep thinking you are the previous login)

**Expected**

lindy.test is in the groupteam qa\
and also team engineering (qa group is a member of engineering group)\
User is in Off-Topic and Town Square only on each team
