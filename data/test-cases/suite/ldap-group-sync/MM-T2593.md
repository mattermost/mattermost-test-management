## MM-T2593: Admin links a channel (but not its team); new user added to channel (and implicitly to team).

---

**Step 1**

Admin links a channel (but not its team); new user added to channel (and implicitly to team).\
————————————————————————————\
sysadmin links xyz group, clicks Configure\
sysadmin links to Channel (not Team), selects xyz channel\
Observe no Remove link next to developers team, but Remove link does appear next to channel\
sysadmin syncs LDAP\
george.test logs in for the first time\
\
\=======\
This is the same as above but with new channel (worth also testing that existing users get the new channel....)\
\
Admin creates a new channel\
Admin links a group to that channel (no team specified explicitly)\
Admin observes there is no Remove link next to the team because it was added implicitly)\
Admin syncs LDAP\
New user logs in for the first time\
\
Added new QA channel to XYZ, created george.test\@simulator.amazonses.com

**Expected**

george.test is in developers team with xyz (private) channel and default channels\
george.test is in engineering team with default channels (developers group is a member of engineering group)\
\
\======\
User is in the groupteam\
User is in Off-Topic and Town Square, plus the channel linked by admin\
\
(User who joined before the new channel was linked is not added to that channel until sync)
