## MM-T2594: Admin batch-unlinks two groups at once

---

**Step 1**

Admin batch-unlinks two groups at once\
————————————————————————————\
Select qa and xyz, unlink\
Sync LDAP\
New user jesus.test\
\
\================\
Admin selects two groups on the Groups page that already have links\
Clicks Unlink Selected groups\
Both appear unlinked in UI and don't have Configure or Edit links

**Expected**

jesus.test only gets engineering team w default channels\
george.test still in dev team w xyz channel and engineering team with default channels\
\
\==============\
Existing user is not removed from teams/channels, even after sync\
\
New user in those groups is not added to the no-longer-linked teams/channels
