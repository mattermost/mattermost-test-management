## MM-T2595: Admin batch-links multiple groups at once

---

**Step 1**

Admin batch-links multiple groups at once\
————————————————————————————\
Select qa, xyz, abc, link (configure abc group to add abc channel)\
Sync LDAP\
New user carlos.test\
\
\===================\
Admin selects two groups on the Groups page\
Clicks Link Selected groups\
Clicks each Configure (or Edit) link and links a team or channel\
After sync, check users from each / both group(s)

**Expected**

Links next to groups say "Configure" (not "Edit")\
\
carlos.test gets Dev team, abc channel; Engineering team, default channels\
\
\
\============================\
Users in each group receive the changes made for that group and not for the other\
\
(figure out some more specific and in-depth combos for this one?)
