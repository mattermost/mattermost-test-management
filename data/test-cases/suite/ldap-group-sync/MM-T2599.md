## MM-T2599: Admin unlinks a team

---

**Step 1**

Admin unlinks a team\
————————————————————————————\
Team and channel is linked to a group\
Admin syncs LDAP\
Verify user in that group is in that team/channel\
Admin removes linked team from the group, confirms in confirmation modal\
Admin syncs LDAP

**Expected**

New user in that group does not join the unlinked team\
\
Existing user in that group is still in that team channel (no auto-removal unless group-constrained)
