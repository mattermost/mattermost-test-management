---

**Step 1**

Remove link behavior in Channel and Team\
————————————————————————————\
Navigate to System Console > Groups and Configure a new Group.\
Click on Add Channel and select a Channel belonging to a team.\
Observe Remove buttons are displayed both for Team and Channel. Reload the page and the behavior should be the same.\
Click on Remove button on the channel, and the Team is still displayed.

**Expected**

Remove buttons should be displayed separately for both the Team and Channel.\
Reloading the page should ensure that the behavior is same.\
Channel should be removed, but the team should not be removed
