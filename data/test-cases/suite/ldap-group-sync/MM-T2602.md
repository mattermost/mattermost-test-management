---

**Step 1**

Remove link behavior in Channel and Team\
————————————————————————————\
Navigate to System Console > Groups and Configure a new Group.\
Click on Add Channel and add two channels belonging to a team.\
Notice Remove buttons are displayed for both the Channels and for the Team.\
Click on Remove button on one of the Channel and reload the page. The channel should be removed, but the other channel and team should still be displayed.\
Click on Remove button again on the Channel and reload the page. The Team should still be displayed.

Remove buttons should be displayed separately for both the Channel and Team.\
Reloading the page should ensure that the behavior is same.\
Channels should be removed, but the team should not be removed
