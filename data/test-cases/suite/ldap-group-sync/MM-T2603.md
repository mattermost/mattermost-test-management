## MM-T2603: User leaves a team that had been linked and then unlinked

---

**Step 1**

User leaves a team that had been linked and then unlinked\
————————————————————————————\
Following after above test (admin links team, syncs, admin unlinks groupteam and syncs, user is not auto-removed)

1. User who is in that groupteam leaves the team
2. Admin syncs again (not making any changes)

**Expected**

- User can remove themselves from the team
- User is not re-added after the step 7 sync
