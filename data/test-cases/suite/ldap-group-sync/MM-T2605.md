## MM-T2605: User leaves a private channel manually, then admin links and syncs

---

**Step 1**

User leaves a private channel manually, then admin links and syncs\
————————————————————————————\
v5.10 testing: carlos.test creates private channel carlos on dev team, leaves it. admin adds carlos channel to engineering group, syncs\\

1. User leaves a private channel
2. Admin links that same private channel to a group the user is in
3. Admin syncs

**Expected**

carlos.test is not re-added to private carlos channel on dev team\
\
other user (william.test) is added to private carlos-channel\
\
User is not re-added to the channel after sync
