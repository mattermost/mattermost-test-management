## MM-T2606: Admin unlinks a channel (and leaves team linked)

---

**Step 1**

Admin unlinks a channel (and leaves team linked)\
————————————————————————————\
admin unlinks private carlos-channel from engineering group, leaves dev team linked (in this example I had to actually unlink, then relink starting with dev team, then adding carlos channel, syncing, then removed carlos channel but left dev team), syncs\
william.test still has carlos-channel\
\
jesse.test logs in for the first time, gets

**Expected**

Confirmation modal to unlink channel\
\
New user does not join the unlinked channel but still joins the team and gets default (and other linked) channels\
\
Existing user who had already been joined to the channel is not removed from the unlinked channel
