## MM-T2608: Admin filters groups

---

**Step 1**

Admin filters groups\
————————————————————————————\
Enable LDAP signin and disable SAML sync w/LDAP, then continue:\
Log in carlos.test using LDAP, observe he gets dev and eng teams\
Add or adjust LDAP Group Filter on LDAP page to filter out ABC group:\
(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(!(cn=Test Group \*))(!(cn=abc)))\
Filtered-out group abc does not appear in list on Groups page\
Admin syncs LDAP\
Log in jesse.test for the first time, observe \[he gets no teams? he gets engineering team? Asking MK because current behavior is different from what I noted in previous testing]\
\
\
Team and channel is linked to a group\
Admin syncs LDAP\
Verify user in that group is in that team/channel\
Admin adds or adjusts LDAP Group Filter (on LDAP page) to filter OUT QA group:\
(|(cn=engineering)(cn=developers)(cn=abc)(cn=xyz))\
or\
(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(!(cn=Test Group \*))(!(cn=qa)))\
\
Filtered-out group does not appear in Groups list\
Admin syncs LDAP\
\
Set filter back to:\
(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(!(cn=Test Group \*)))

**Expected**

New user in that group does not join the previously linked team/channel (but does join higher-up groups such as engineering when qa group is filtered out, because they're still in that group in AD/LDAP after all and it's still linked in Mm)\
\
Existing user in that group is NOT auto-removed from the previously linked team/channel, and also remains in the "higher-up" groups (because as far as LDAP is concerned, user is still a member of engineering because they are a member of qa which is a member of engineering, even though qa isn't linked)
