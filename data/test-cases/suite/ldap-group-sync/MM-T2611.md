## MM-T2611: Admin deactivates and reactivates in LDAP

---

**Step 1**

Admin deactivates and reactivates in LDAP
————————————————————————————
Logged in to create following users with the following linked team/channels:
linda.test qa group qa team and private channel, eng team with default channels
george.test xyz dev team and 2 private channels (standup and xyz), eng team with default channels
corey.test eng eng team with default channels
lindy.test qa group qa team and private channel, eng team with default channels

MK in AD deactivates linda.test, george.test, and corey.test
User filter to filter out deactivated users (such as (&(objectClass=person)(!(cn=Test.*))(!(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))
), then LDAP sync

Deactivated users cannot log in to Mm, show in Mm as Inactive
Deactivated users do not appear in Groups user lists

MK in AD reactivates users
LDAP sync (leaving in the filter that filters out deactivated users)

All three users can log in again
All three users have the same team/channels they had before
All three users appear in the appropriate Group user lists
