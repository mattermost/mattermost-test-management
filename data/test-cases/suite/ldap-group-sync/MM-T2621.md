---

**Step 1**

Team List Management Column\
————————————————————————————

1. Ensure there are at least two teams present on an instance.
2. For one group, set Anyone can join this team to true and for the other team, set this to false.
3. On the System Console ➜ Team List page, check the Management column

(**Story**) [Team list 'Management' column shows open team as 'Manual Invite' — MM-17379](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17379)

**Expected**

- Management column should be displayed correctly as per the team settings.
- If a team is allowed to be joined by anyone, then in the management column, it should display "Anyone Can Join". Else it should display "Manual Invites"
