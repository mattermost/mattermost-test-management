## MM-T2638: Permalink from when public does not auto-join (non-system-admin) after converting to private

---

**Step 1**

Permalink from when public does not auto-join (non-system-admin) after converting to private\
————————————————————————————

1. While channel is still public, post a message
2. Copy the permalink for that message
3. Post the permalink in Off-Topic
4. Leave the channel, click the link in Off-Topic, verify channel is re-joined
5. Leave channel again to prepare for testing after conversion

**Expected**

- After conversion to private, permalink does not auto-join the channel (non-admin user)
