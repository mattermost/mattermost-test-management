## MM-T2640: Channel appears in channel switcher before conversion but not after (for non-members of the channel)

---

**Step 1**

Channel appears in channel switcher before conversion but not after (for non-members of the channel)\
————————————————————————————

1. While channel is still public, verify it appears in channel switcher for user in it, and for user not in it

**Expected**

- After conversion, channel appears for users who are in it, but not for users who are not in it
