## MM-T2642: Channel appears in Integrations options before conversion but not after

---

**Step 1**

Channel appears in Integrations options before conversion but not after\
————————————————————————————

1. While channel is still public (and you're a member), verify it appears as option in Integrations ➜ Outgoing Webhooks ➜ New Outgoing Webhook ➜ Channel

**Expected**

- After conversion (still a member of the channel), channel does not appear as option for new Outgoing Webhook
