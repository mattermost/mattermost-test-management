## MM-T2650: Constrain channel, users are listed who will be removed

---

**Step 1**

Constrain channel, users are listed who will be removed\
————————————————————————————\
General testing approach:

1. Create a public channel

2. Have several users join it, including users who log in via:

   - Email/password
   - LDAP, in the group you're going to sync with the channel (constrain)
   - LDAP, not in the group you're going to sync with the channel (constrain), but in ➜1 other LDAP groups
   - OAuthHave users who are in the group you're going to sync with the channel (constrain) log in but do not join the channel

3. In System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Channels, find the channel ➜ Edit

4. Sync Group Members, Add Group, select qa group, click Add button

5. Observe warning message at bottom: Count of users who will be removed (link to view them, in modal the users' groups are listed (in links if more than one))

6. Click Save

7. Observe warning modal: Count of users who will be removed

**Expected**

**This test does not cover**:

- SAML (without SAML syncing with LDAP; try separately with SAML syncing with LDAP)
