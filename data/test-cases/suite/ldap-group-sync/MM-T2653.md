## MM-T2653: Users in removal warning modal are paginated

---

**Step 1**

Users in removal warning modal are paginated\
————————————————————————————

1. With LDAP group sync enabled and at least one group linked (but not constrained) to a team:
2. Add 25 users to that team who are not in that group (email/password users, for example)
3. System admin: Enable group constraint (sync) on System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Teams ➜ ^that team's management page
4. Warning displays, saying that users will be removed from the team
5. Click to view the users who will be removed
6. Scroll to the bottom of the list
