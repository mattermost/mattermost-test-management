## MM-T2660: Exclude deactivated user from group count

---

**Step 1**

Exclude deactivated user from group count\
————————————————————————————

1. Create a group; know the user count.
2. Deactivate a user in the group.
3. Browse the various places the group member count appears (chat-facing adding and managing groups on both teams and channels, admin console teams, admin console channels, admin console group details).
4. Count member count should be correct in all of them, decrementing correctly the count because of the user that was deactivated.

**Expected**

- Count member count should be correct in all of them, decrementing correctly the count because of the user that was deactivated.
