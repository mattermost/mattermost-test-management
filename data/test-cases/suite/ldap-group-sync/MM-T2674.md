## MM-T2674: Promote Channel Role Permission

---

**Step 1**

Promote Channel Role Permission\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Channel, select a Group and set the Role to Members in System Console ➜ Channels page.
2. Run LDAP Group Sync job and check if user has access to the Channel with Channel Member permission.
3. Change the role from Members to Channel Admin for the same channel in System Console ➜ Channels page.
4. User should immediately be updated to Channel Admin role and should be able to perform Channel Admin tasks like view and modify Channel Members, Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User still has Channel Admin permission for that Channel.
