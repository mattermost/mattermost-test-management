## MM-T2675: Demote Channel Role Permission

---

**Step 1**

Demote Channel Role Permission\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Channel, select a Group and set the Role to Channel Admin in System Console ➜ Channels page.
2. Run LDAP Group Sync job and check if user has access to the Channel with Channel Admin permission.
3. Change the role from Channel Admin to Members for the same channel in System Console ➜ Channels page.
4. User should immediately be updated to Channel Member role and should not be able to perform Channel Admin tasks like view and modify Channel Members, Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User still has Channel Member permission for that Channel.
