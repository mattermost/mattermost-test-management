## MM-T2676: Promote Team Role Permission

---

**Step 1**

Promote Team Role Permission\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Team, select a Group and set the Role to Members in System Console ➜ Teams page.
2. Run LDAP Group Sync job and check if user has access to the Team with Member permission.
3. Change the role from Members to Team Admin for the same team in System Console ➜ Teams page.
4. User should immediately be updated to Team Admin role and should be able to perform Team Admin tasks like view and modify Team Settings, Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User still has Team Admin permission for that Team.
