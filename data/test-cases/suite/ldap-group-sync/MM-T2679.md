## MM-T2679: Channel Role ignores Guest Users

---

**Step 1**

Channel Role ignores Guest Users\
————————————————————————————

1. Set Guest Filter in LDAP Configuration page such that some users are marked as Guest.
2. Login as LDAP users matching the Guest Filter and ensure that their account is created as a Guest.
3. For a new Channel, select a Group and set the Role to Channel Admin in System Console ➜ Channels page.
4. Check if all users who are not Guest Users have Channel Admin permissions.
5. Guest Users should have only Channel Guest permissions and should not be promoted to Channel Admin.
