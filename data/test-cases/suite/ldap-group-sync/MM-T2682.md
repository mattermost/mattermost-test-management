## MM-T2682: Chat Facing ➜ Team ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Team Admins

---

**Step 1**

Chat Facing ➜ Team ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Team Admins\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Team, login as a user User1 who has Team Admin permissions.
2. For the same group synced team, on a different browser, login as a user User2 who has Team Member permissions.
3. As User1, Click on Manage Groups from Main menu and then set the role to Team Admins for a Group which User2 belongs to.
4. User2 should immediately be updated to Team Admin role and should be able to perform Team Admin tasks like view and modify Team Settings, Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User2 still has Team Admin permission for that Team.
