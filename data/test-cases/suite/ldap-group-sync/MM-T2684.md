## MM-T2684: Chat Facing ➜ Channel ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Channel Admins

---

**Step 1**

Chat Facing ➜ Channel ➜ Manage Groups ➜ Make Channel Admins\
————————————————————————————

1. For a Group Synced Channel, login as a user User1 who has Channel Admin permissions.
2. For the same group synced channel, on a different browser, login as a user User2 who has Channel Member permissions.
3. As User1, Click on Channel Dropdown and select Manage Groups and then set the role to Channel Admins for a Group which User2 belongs to.
4. User2 should immediately be updated to Channel Admin role and should be able to perform Channel Admin tasks like Manage Groups etc.
5. Run LDAP Group Sync job again and check if user User2 still has Channel Admin permission for that Team.
