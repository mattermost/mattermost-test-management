## MM-T3833: Team sidebar > team icon appearance and badge count

---

**Step 1**

1. Create or join few teams

2. Create some unreads in one channel

   1. Verify unread dot position

3. Select one team

   1. Verify selected state with team sidebar color border

4. Hover over a different team

   1. Verify team icon on hover border

5. Click and hold on the team icon and move it

   1. Verify team icon gives a slight 2 px down movement when moving
   2. Icon has a selected border while moved and inner stroke maintains Team Sidebar color while moved
   3. badge, if present, moves along with the icon(see image in test data for example)

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- Verify selected state shows sidebar active color
- Verify team icon hover border
- Verify team icon appearance and styling when rearranging icons (moving and dropping)

---

**Step 2**

1. Create at least 2 teams, Team A and Team B

2. Open Team A

3. Have another user mention you 100+ times on Team B (use `/test posts 100` or more, may have to be repeated few times which should create significant number of mentions)

   1. Verify the mention count for 1, 2 and for 3 digit mentions. More than 3 digits should display as `99+`

**Expected**

- Verify styling of 1, 2 and 3 digit mentions
- Badge should not interfere with the other team icons and have only one border
