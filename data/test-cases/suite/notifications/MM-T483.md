## MM-T483: Channel-wide mentions with uppercase

---

**Step 1**

Channel-wide mentions with uppercase\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Send a post containing `\[at]ALL`. Note that the autocomplete will try to make that lowercase so you'll either need to paste it or hit escape to dismiss the autocomplete

**Test Data**

\[at]ALL

**Expected**

- The post in the channel appears as `@All`
