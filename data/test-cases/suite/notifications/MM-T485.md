## MM-T485: Keywords that trigger notifications - Channel-wide mentions at-HERE in all caps

---

**Step 1**

Words that trigger mentions - Channel-wide mentions\
\
at-HERE in all caps\
\--------------------

1. Click the hamburger main menu
2. Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"
3. Click ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù to the right of ‚ÄúWords that trigger mentions‚Äù
4. Select "channel-wide mentions "\[\[at]channel], \[\[at]all], \[\[at]here]""
5. Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù
6. Use another account to post `\[at]here` (in all caps)
7. Note: Pressing "Esc" after typing `\[at]here` will keep it in caps otherwise the autocomplete changes it to lowercase letters

**Expected**

- You receive a notification, channel is bolded in LHS and shows a mention jewel
- Post appears as `@HERE`
- The at-here is highlighted
