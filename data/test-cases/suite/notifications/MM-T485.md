## MM-T485: Keywords that trigger notifications - Channel-wide mentions at-HERE in all caps

---

**Step 1**

Words that trigger mentions - Channel-wide mentions\
\
`@HERE` in all caps\
\--------------------

1. Click icon to open up the `Settings` modal.
2. Notice `Notifications` section is preselected.
3. Click `Edit` to the right of `Keywords that trigger mentions`.
4. Select `Channel-wide mentions "@channel", "@all", "@here` then `Save`.
5. Use other account to post `@HERE` (in all caps)\
   Note: Pressing `Esc` after typing `@HERE` will keep it in caps otherwise the autocomplete changes it to lowercase letters

**Expected**

- You receive a notification, channel is bolded in LHS and shows a mention jewel with count.
- Post appears as `@HERE` and is highlighted.
