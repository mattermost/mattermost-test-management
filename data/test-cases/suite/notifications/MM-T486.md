## MM-T486: Users with the same firstname in their username should not get a mention when one of them leaves a channel

---

**Step 1**

Users with the same firstname in their username should not get a mention when one of them leaves a channel\
––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create two test users - "test" and "test.one"
2. "test" user create a new channel and add "test.one" to it
3. "test.one" go to the new channel so that the mention badge received for being added to the channel disappears
4. "test" user go to Off-Topic channel
5. "test.one" leave the new channel you were added to by "test" user
