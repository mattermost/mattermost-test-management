**Step 1**

Display teammate nickname when nickname exists\
\--------------------\
Push Notification Contents must be set to Send full message Snippet in System Console, such as rc.test.mattermost.com:\
\
1\. As the test user open Account Settings>> Display>> Teammate Name Display\
2\. Set the display to Show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name\
3\. Have another user who has a nickname post a mention for the test user in a group message channel with other users to send a notification

**Expected**

1\. Test user sees the notification\
2\. Notification header shows the name of the users in the GM by nickname\
3\. Sender's name is displayed as nickname\
4\. @mention in the message content shows the username of the test user\
\
Note: desktop notification not applicable to RN apps

\--------------------\
Push Notification Contents must be set to Send full message Snippet in System Console, such as rc.test.mattermost.com:\
\
1\. As the test user open Account Settings>> Display>> Teammate Name Display\
2\. Set the display to Show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name\
3\. Have another user who does not have a nickname post a mention for the test user in a group message channel with other users to send a notification
