## MM-T491: No desktop notification when in focus

---

**Step 1**

No desktop notification when in focus\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. View a channel
2. Use another account to post in that channel: "/echo test 3" to post a message with a delay of 3 seconds
3. Before the echo posts, make sure to focus your computer on the first user viewing the channel

**Expected**

- No desktop notification is sent for Account A since it is being actively viewed and is in focus.
