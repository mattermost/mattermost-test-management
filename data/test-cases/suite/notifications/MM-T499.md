**Precondition**

––––––––––––––––––––––––––

3. Click "Edit" to the right of "Desktop Notification Sounds"
4. Select "Off"
5. Click "Save"

_Important notes about this step:_

- In Windows OS, system sound may also play; has to be disabled separately in the OS. May be variations based on whether window is in focus as well.
- Some browsers like Edge and Firefox don't allow sound configuration in Account Settings; help text directs all users to configure sound settings in their browser.

- If the "Off" radio button is selected the drop-down sound list will be hidden
