## MM-T504: Email Notifications Batching On - 15 minutes

---

**Step 1**

Email Notifications\
Batching On - 15 minutes\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Note**: Ensure Email Batching is "true" in the System Console ➜ Notifications ➜ Email Section\
\
Also ensure your status is set to Away or Offline (can set from drop-down in top left or use /away or /offline)

1. Click on the hamburger menu to the right of the team name in the LHS
2. Select "Account Settings" then select "Notifications"
3. Click "Edit" to the right of "Email Notifications"
4. Select "15 minutes"
5. Click "Save"
6. Minimize or put in background your browser / desktop so you won't accidentally interact with it for the next 15 minutes
7. Have another user send some mentions and direct messages that would trigger an email notification
8. Check your email right away to verify not receiving notifications immediately
9. After 15 minutes, check your email for the batched email notification

**Test Data**

(LM) This is covered in System Console

**Expected**

- Email notifications are batched into one email sent 15 minutes after first being mentioned. Any other mentions or DMs received in this time period are batched together in the email. The "Go to Post" button on each message in the email correctly permalinks to each message.
