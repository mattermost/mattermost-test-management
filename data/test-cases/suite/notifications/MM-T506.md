## MM-T506: Channel links show as links in notification emails

---

**Step 1**

1. Ensure "Send email notifications" is set to "immediately" in Account Settings ➜ Notifications ➜ Email Notifications
2. Log in to the same server with two test users (User A and User B)
3. Ensure both users belong to the same channel (e.g. can be Off-Topic or Town Square) and that User B has an email account you can check emails for
4. Make sure to set user B's status to 'away' or 'offline' to trigger the email notification
5. As User A, send an at-mention to User B and include a link to a channel (e.g. `This is a message in \~off-topic channel for @userB`)
6. As User B, go to your email and click on the email notification

- (**Story - Unscheduled**): [Cross team channel linking — MM-6482](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-6482)

_Important notes about this step:_

Until cross-team channel linking is implemented, channel links sent from direct/group messages will not show as links in an email.

**Test Data**

This is a message in \~off-topic channel for @userB

**Expected**

- User B should see Off-Topic channel linked as a channel link (\~off-topic) in the email
