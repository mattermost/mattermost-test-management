2\. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right of your screen\
3\. Tap "Settings", then "Notifications"\
4\. Tap "Mentions and Replies"\
5\. Ensure the following settings:\
\

(Note: This setting does not appear if the account does not have a first name set)\
\- Non-case-sensitive username = Off\
\
Go back to the Notifications Settings\
1\. Tap "Mobile"\
2\. Ensure the following settings\
\
\- Send notifications = Only for mentions and direct messages\
\
6\. Go back to channel view and lock device screen or put in background.\
7\. Have another user make a post in channelA that includes your first name, lowercase, such as\
