---

**Step 1**

1\. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right of your screen\
2\. Tap "Settings", then "Notifications"\
3\. Tap "Mentions and Replies"\
4\. Ensure the following settings:\
\
\- Channel-wide mentions = On\
\- Keywords = {enter some keyword here}\
\
Go back to the Notifications Settings\
1\. Tap "Mobile"\
2\. Ensure the following setting:\
\
\- Send notifications = Only for mentions and direct messages\
\
Go back to channel view and lock device screen or put in background.\
\
Have another user make five posts, all in different channels that you're a member of, like so:\
\
1\. `\[at]channel` in one channel (mention)\
2\. `\[at]all` in another channel (mention)\
3\. any text that includes your keyword (mention)\
4\. a DM with you (mention)\
5\. a GM that includes you, with none of your mention words in it (no mention)

**Expected**

Settings are saved.\
\
Mentions fire or do not fire as described in the test steps.\
\
Channel-wide notifications say something like "username posted a message" (depending on settings)\
At-mentions say "username mentioned you"\
\
Can tap notification to view the message.\
\
As described, there should be (4) mentions.\
\
Non-mention still appears as unread.
