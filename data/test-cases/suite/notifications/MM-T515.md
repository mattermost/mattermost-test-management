## MM-T515: RN apps: Push NotificationsNo `@` before Nickname or Firstname/Lastname

---

**Step 1**

1. In a browser, Account Settings ➜ Display ➜ Teammate Name Display = "Show nickname if one exists, otherwise show first and last name" OR "Show first and last name"
2. Also in a browser, Account Settings ➜ Notifications ➜ Mobile Push Notifications = "For all activity" AND "Online, away or offline"
3. In an incognito window, log in as another test user and post a message that will fire a push notification to your user from step 1
