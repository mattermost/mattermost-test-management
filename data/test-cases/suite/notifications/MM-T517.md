## MM-T517: RN apps: Push Notifications `@` _is_ included before Username

---

**Step 1**

1\. In a browser, Account Settings ➜ Display ➜ Teammate Name Display = "Show username"\
2\. Also in a browser, Account Settings ➜ Notifications ➜ Mobile Push Notifications = "For all activity" AND "Online, away or offline"\
3\. In an incognito window, log in as another test user and post a message that will fire a push notification to your user from step 1)
