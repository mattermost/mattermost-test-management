## MM-T520: RN apps: Notifications - Mention badges

---

**Step 1**

RN Apps Notifications - Mention badges\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**Ensure your user has at least two teams, in order to view team sidebar / drawer**

1. Put app into the background or lock screen

2. Have another user mention you in a \*public\* channel of a team you are not currently viewing

3. Do not tap the notification to view the post but instead re-open the app using the app launcher icon.\
   **Observe**:

   - app icon
   - channel drawer
   - team button in channel drawer
   - team sidebar

_Important notes about this step:_

**Important**:

- If you're testing with Android and have replaced the stock launcher in your device then you may need to install another launcher such as [Microsoft Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher&hl=en_US) and change the notification settings to show number badges instead of just dots in case your current launcher doesn't show notification badges. Please ask QA for help on Android if needed.
- iOS users do not need anything additional installed.

**Expected**

- Mention badge appears on app icon, channel drawer, team name in team drawer
- Mention badge should appear bold and large number in channel view, channel sidebar view, and team sidebar view (see images below)
