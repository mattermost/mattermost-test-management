---

**Step 1**

Opening the app does not clear notifications (or badges)\
\--------------------\
1\. As user1 launch the app and open a specific channel\
2\. Place the app in the backgroud\
3\. As user2, metion the user1 in 2 or 3 channels OTHER than the channel noted in step 1\
4\. As user1 note the notifications coming through for mentions (do not select them)\
5\. As user1 launch the app then return it to the background\
6\. Return to the app and open one of the channels where you received a mention

**Expected**

Mention and badge for that channel (only) are both cleared when you view the channel
