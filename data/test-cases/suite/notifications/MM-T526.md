## MM-T526: RN Apps: app icon notification badge increments number up for each mention and down when channel is opened from notification

**Precondition**

**Note: ANDROID needs to install another launcher such as Microsoft Launcher and change the notification settings to show number badge instead of just dot badge. Please ask QA for help on Android if needed. iOS does not need anything additional installed.**

**Step 1**

\*\*Note: ANDROID needs to install another launcher such as Microsoft Launcher and change the notification settings to show number badge instead of just dot badge. \*\*\
Please ask QA for help on Android if needed. iOS does not need anything additional installed.\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
**On Android app**:

1. As user A, be a member of 3 channels: Town Square, Off Topic, and one other one
2. View the other channel (so you're not in the channels you're getting mentions in)
3. Return to the home screen (launcher)
4. Have a User B mention you once in Town Square
5. Observe badge count on app icon increments up by 1
6. Have User B mention you once in Off Topic, observe badge count increments up again by 1
7. Tap that second notification to open the post
8. Go back to home screen (launcher)

[RN Android: Notification badge count isn't updated when using multiple channels — MM-18947](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18947)

_Important notes about this step:_

**Notes**:

- Android needs third-party launcher such as Microsoft Launcher installed to show badge numbers (instead of just dots)

**Expected**

Badge count on app icon is back down to 1 (incremented back down by one when you read one of the mentions but did not clear both)
