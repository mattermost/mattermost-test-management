## MM-T531: RN apps: ANDROID ONLY - Push notifications received without having to set up in app settings

---

**Step 1**

RN Android\
\- Push notifications received without having to set up in app settings\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Uninstall MM (this test needs a fresh install without upgrading to the next version)
2. Reinstall MM (no upgrade)
3. Log in and do not change any push notification settings on your device
4. From another test user, send a message that you know will trigger a push notification (e.g. a DM)

(**Story - Invalid**) [RN Android: No (1) on App Icon after receiving push notification — MM-14467](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14467)

_Important notes about this step:_

[MM-14467](http://FIXED%20v1.22%20https%3A//mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14467) closed as "invalid" - badge behavior can vary

**Expected**

- You should receive a push notification banner, and a sound plays when push notification received
- May also show a (1) badge icon on the app icon, but that can depend on the device/os version: MM-14467 / <https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/badges.html>
