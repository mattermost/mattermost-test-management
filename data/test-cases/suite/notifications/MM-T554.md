## MM-T554: Reply Notifications – that I start or participate in – participate in the thread

---

**Step 1**

Reply Notifications - that I start or participate in - participate in the thread\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As **User A** and with "Trigger notifications on messages in reply threads that I start or participate in" selected in Account settings, reply to a parent post made by a different account.
2. Use a second test account to make a comment on the same parent post.
3. As **User A**, tap the push notification when it is received.

**Note**: Desktop notifications must be set to "For all activity" to receive the notification. If it's set to "Only for mentions and direct message" and the user is mentioned or in a non DM channel they won't receive a notification.

- (Cannot Reproduce) [Reply mentions are only triggered on every other post — MM-27505](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-27050)

**Expected**

- **User A** should receive a mention notification on the comment made by the second test account
- The reply bar on the reply that triggered the mention should be highlighted
