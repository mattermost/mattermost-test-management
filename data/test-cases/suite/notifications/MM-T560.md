---

**Step 1**

Browser tab and team sidebar unreads and mentions - Mention in different team\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. With an account on two teams, view team A, make sure no unreads or mentions
2. Have another user view team B
3. Have the other user post in any channel on team B
4. Have the other user post an at-mention for you in any channel on on team B

_Important notes about this step:_

Safari does not show the updated favicon with mention and unread dots, continues to use \* for unread and number with \* for mentions

**Expected**

- At step 1: Favicon shows default without dot when there is no mention or unread

* At step 3: Favicon shows with blue dot when there are only unreads, without mention
* At step 4: Browser tab displays: (1) \[channel name] - \[team name] Mattermost.\
  Favicon shows red dot when there are mentions.

- Team sidebar: Small dot left of team B icon in team sidebar, and a mention badge in top right corner of the badge with number "1"\
  \
  \*Not supported in Safari

---

**Step 2**

Team sidebar icon - Badge with mention count increments when added to channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. With an account on two teams(A\&B), view and remain on team A
2. Have another user view team B
3. Have the other user add you to channel on team B

[Team sidebar icon - Badge with mention count does not increment when added to channel — MM-28290](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-28290)

**Expected**

- Browser tab - Mention badge increases e.g. (2)
- Team sidebar - Mention badge in top right corner of the team B icon with number "1" or if the existing badge count is present it should incremented to reflect test user being added to new channel on this team
