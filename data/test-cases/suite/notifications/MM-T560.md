[Team sidebar icon - Badge with mention count does not increment when added to channel — MM-28290](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-28290)

**Expected**

- Browser tab - Mention badge increases e.g. (2)
- Team sidebar - Mention badge in top right corner of the team B icon with number "1" or if the existing badge count is present it should incremented to reflect test user being added to new channel on this team
