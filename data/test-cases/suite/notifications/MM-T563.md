_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: You _will not_ see a "More Unreads ↑" indicator appears at top of channel list on LHS for User A. [See MM-26427 for more information](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-26427).

**Expected**

- User A: "↓ Jump to new messages" indicator appears at top of center panel
