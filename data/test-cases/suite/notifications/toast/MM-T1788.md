## MM-T1788: Toast count

---

**Step 1**

Toast count\
————————————————————————————

1. Open a channel with a lot of unreads ensuring toast is present
2. Observe the toast count as new messages are received

_Related ticket(s):_

[listen to new messages arriving on the channel for toast state update — MM-19535](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19535)

**Expected**

- Once the toast is up, it should listen to the websocket for new messages coming in, updating the counter.
