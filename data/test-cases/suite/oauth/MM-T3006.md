1\. On mysql.test, System Console > Users\
2\. Log in as system admin and search for your Google Apps user (e.g. first.last\@mattermost.com)\
3\. If that user does not exist on the server, pass this test and go on to step 2.\
4\. If that user is already on server and set to log in using Google, use the drop-down next to the user to change it to email/password login, and enter new password\
5\. Log out as system admin, log in as the other user, change email address (to one you can still check), name, and username, and log out. You will need to verify your new email address in order to make the change effective
