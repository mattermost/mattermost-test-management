## MM-T3007: OAuth SSO: GitLab – Selenium tests (10)

**Precondition**

AuthGitLab.html

---

**Step 1**

**Account creation disabled**\
1\. With GitLab set up, set System Console > Users and Teams > "Enable Account Creation" to false\
2\. Open login page in separate or incognito browser\
3\. Click to create a new account, click to use GitLab

**Expected**

Cannot create new account with SSO: error page "Error User sign-up is disabled. Back to Mattermost"\
\
Then set account creation back to TRUE

---

**Step 2**

**Create new account using GitLab**\
1\. Go to Main Menu > Send Email Invite and send to email address associated with GitLab account (can also use team invite link and skip sending/receiving the email, or just click to create a new account if it's an open server)\
2\. Logout\
3\. Click the invite link in the email\
4\. On the sign up page, click "Sign Up with GitLab"\
5\. Sign up with a gitlab account that is not already used on the server

**Expected**

Account is created and team is joined

---

**Step 3**

**Switch GitLab SSO to email / password**\
1\. Sign in with an account using GitLab SSO\
2\. Go to Account Settings -> Security -> Signin Method\
3\. Switch to email sign in\
4\. Observe success message\
5\. Log back in with email

**Expected**

Sign in method should switch to email and login is successful

---

**Step 4**

**Try to log in with GitLab after changing to email / password**\
1\. After switching GitLab account to sign in using email (in test above) 2. Log out of the server and try to use your GitLab account to sign in

**Expected**

Error message displays about email address already in use: "There is already an account associated with that email address using a sign in method other than gitlab. Please sign in using email."

---

**Step 5**

**Can switch back to GitLab login method and log in**\
15\. Log in using email / password\
16\. In Account Settings > Security, switch signin method back to GitLab login\
17\. Observe success message\
18\. Log in usingGitLab

**Expected**

\- Login is successful using GitLab

---

**Step 6**

**Update User Attributes in GitLab**\
1\. Sign in using GitLab\
2\. Verify Account Settings > General Settings show that username and email are set in GitLab,\
3\. Edit first and last name\
4\. Log out of Mattermost\
5\. In GitLab:Update email in Profile, and username in Account. Make note of full name\
6\. Log back in to Mattermost using GitLab

**Expected**

Full name, username and email in Account Settings update to match what's in GitLab\
\
Email may not update until after it's verified depending on System Console setting re: email verification\
\
(Could then click in verification email to verify new email address, and verify in Mattermost that email address updated)

---

**Step 7**

**Deactivate in Mattermost, user reactivates on SSO**\
Deactivate user in Mm, verify warning message "You must also deactivate this user in the SSO provider or they will be reactivated on next login or sync."\
\
User re-signs in using GL\
\
System admin refreshes viewing the user in System Console

**Expected**

User is reactivated on re-signing in using GitLab

---

**Step 8**

**GitLab Disabled -> Not available for signin**\
1\. System Console: Set ""Enable authentication with GitLab:"" = false (Team Edition), or System Console > OAuth 2.0: ""Select OAuth Provider"" to Do not allow sign-in via an OAuth 2.0 provider (Enterprise)\
\
(fields will repopulate after you set it back to GitLab, but if two OAuth methods are in place, only one of them will return to the login page)

**Expected**

Team Edition: GitLab fields become uneditable, login page does not have GitLab signin button, account creation page does not have option for GitLab Sign up.\
\
Enterprise Edition: Gitlab fields are hidden from page.

---

**Step 9**

**GitLab Settings: Pre-populate**\
1\. In GitLab settings, observe the GitLab Site URL\
2\. Observe the fields below it are pre-populated based on that URL and are not editable\
3\. Edit the GitLab Site URL and observe the changes in the fields below (do not save changes)

**Expected**

Fields pre-populate based on Site URL and are not editable:\
User API Endpoint\
Auth Endpoint\
Token Endpoint

---

**Step 10**

**Correct message if user has not authorized MM in GitLab**\
1\. If you've already authorized GitLab to log in to the Mattermost server:\
\- Log in to GitLab (not Mm), click on the down arrow to the right of your profile icon top right > Settings > Applications\
\- scroll down to Authorized Applications and revoke access from the Mattermost server you're testing on (NOTE: rctesting will be listed as `MattermostTest`)\
2\. Log out your Mattermost GitLab account\
3\. On login page, click to log in using GitLab\
4\. GitLab login page appears (unless you're already logged in to GitLab in the background)\
5\. Log in to GitLab (unless you're already logged in)\
6\. On the ""authorize \[MM-server-name] to use your account click on ""Deny""\
7\. On the ""Authorization Error"" page, click on ""Back to log in page""\
8\. Observe error page displaying "Authorization Error - You must authorize Mattermost to log in with Gitlab. - Back to login page"\
9\. Click to log in using GitLab\
10\. Click to Authorize\
11\. Attempt login again

**Expected**

\- Login is successful again after re-authorizing
