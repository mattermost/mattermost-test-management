**Important**: Test this on a mobile device browser (_not the Mattermost RN app_)

**Step 1**

2. Open incognito **BROWSER** on your PHONE (or new browser session), _NOT the RN app_
3. Paste the team invite link into the browser address bar of the new or incognito mobile browser session
4. User is directed to \[server]/get\_android\_app (or iOS)
5. Tap "Continue with browser"

**Expected**

Account Creation page is displayed instead of login page
