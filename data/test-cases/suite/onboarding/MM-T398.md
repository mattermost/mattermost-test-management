2. Copy the link
3. Log out or open an incognito window
4. Paste the link in
5. On the Sign Up page, click "Email and password"
6. Enter a username and email address that you can access (can use plus sign, such as \`linda+test\@mattermost.com), and a password
7. Click "Create Account"
8. Verify URL on `You are almost done...` screen does not have `undefined` team name
9. Receive email with link to verify email address, click the link (or open it in incognito window), and enter password

_Important notes about this step:_

**Note**: Known issue browser in mobile view: Text overflow on button: <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23870>

**Expected**

- Step 8. Starting in v5.24 URL in address bar does not have an `undefined` team name appended
- Email verification is successful and account is created.
- On the login page, email is pre-filled with focus on the password field.
- Once filled out you are redirected to the login page
- If the email address and username you use is properly formatted you **do not** see an error that reads "_Enter a valid email or username and/or password, or sign in using another method._"
