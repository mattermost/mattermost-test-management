## MM-T5414: Onboarding flow for newly installed Self-managed server

**Objective**

- Verify the functionality of the Self-managed onboarding flow for the person installing the new server.

Note: This test only addresses the different screens encountered during the setup of the server and not the actual onboarding steps once the server is up and running. Those steps are covered in a different test case.

**Precondition**

These steps assume that you've installed the server and have created an admin account before proceeding.

---

**Step 1**

1\. Upon successful installation of a Self-managed server the first admin is presented with a page asking them to name their organization. Verify filling in a name allows the admin to continue onto the next step.

2\. The next step of onboarding opens up the "What tools do you use?" screen. Verify that you can select as many or as few (including none) as you'd like and both the "Continue" or the "Skip" buttons allow you to move on.

3\. The next step opens up the "Invite your team members" page. Verify that clicking the "Copy Invite" button copies the URL to the clipboard and that clicking "Finish setup" moves you along to the "Launching your workspace now" transition page with an animation playing to indicate that it's not stuck in the process.

4\. Verify that the transition page moves automatically to the server workspace with the admin onboarding steps already expanded.

**Expected**

The end result is that the server is in place with a team name that matches the name you provided in the Company name screen (step 1) as well as with any plugins that were selected in step 2 and that it's ready to use.
