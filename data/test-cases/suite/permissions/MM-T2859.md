————————————————————————————\
1\. Login as an admin\
2\. Open the console and Delete the scheme created above while the team is still associated with it\
3\. Login as a member of that team\
4\. Observe the permissions available to the user

**Expected**

The permissions available to the team have reverted to what is granted by the system scheme
