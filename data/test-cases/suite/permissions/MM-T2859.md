---

**Step 1**

After a scheme is deleted, associated teams will revert to global system scheme\
————————————————————————————\
1\. Login as an admin\
2\. Open the console and Delete the scheme created above while the team is still associated with it\
3\. Login as a member of that team\
4\. Observe the permissions available to the user

**Expected**

The permissions available to the team have reverted to what is granted by the system scheme
