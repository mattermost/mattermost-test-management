## MM-T2862: Default permissions set inherited from system scheme

---

**Step 1**

Default permissions set inherited from system scheme\
————————————————————————————\
1\. As an admin user, open the console\
2\. Navigate to Permission Schemes and click Edit Scheme for the system level\
3\. Make a few changes to the current system scheme and take note of the changes\
4\. Click save\
5\. Return to the Permission Schemes page and click New Team Override Scheme\
6\. On the scheme creation page note the default configuration of permissions and ensure changes made in step 3 are reflected

**Expected**

system scheme - including changes made to it - is used as the default configuration while creating an override scheme
