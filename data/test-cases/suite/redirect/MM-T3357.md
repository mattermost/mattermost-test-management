**Precondition**

Manual test only. Not able to automate.

**Step 1**

Client side ping pong and disconnect banner

1. Open Dev Tools > Network tab > WS (to view active websocket connection)
2. Refresh the page after opening
3. Select the first WS event to see details on the right -observe ping events coming every 10 seconds
4. Disconnect Wifi and verify disconnect banner appears on the server

**Expected**

- Verify 10 second ping
- Verify banner is present after loss of connection
