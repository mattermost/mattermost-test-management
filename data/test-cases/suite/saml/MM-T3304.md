## MM-T3304: SAML-only server: Email invite to new guest, can sign up using SAML

---

**Step 1**

Ensure guest accounts are enabled on the server (can use mysql.test).\
Also ensure SAML is the only signup / signin method active on the server.\
1.Send a \*guest\* invite by email to a user not already on the server\
2\. Open the link in an Incognito browser\
3\. Create an account via the SAML option (known issue that this flow requires clicking the SAML button twice)\
4\. Enter valid SAML credentials and submit (OneLogin in the case of mysql.test)

**Expected**

Guest account is created, team is joined, and the user has access to the specified channel.
