## MM-T2348: RN apps: Show Untrusted Certificate prompt when connecting to a server with invalid SSL or invalid host

---

**Step 1**

RN Apps: Show Untrusted Certificate prompt when connecting to a server with invalid SSL or invalid host\
\--------------------\
1\. Enter server URL with invalid SSL (expired.badssl.com) and hit Connect\
2\. Enter server URL with invalid host (wrong.host.badssl.com) and hit Connect

_Related ticket(s):_

<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-18642>

**Expected**

After #1 or #2,

- User should be prompted with **Invalid SSL Certificate**,

  - `The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be "expired.badssl.com" which could put your confidential information at risk.`
