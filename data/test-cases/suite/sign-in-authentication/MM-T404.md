## MM-T404: Set up Multi-factor Authentication (Email login) - Enabled but not enforced

---

**Step 1**

Set up Multi-factor Authentication\
(Email login) - Enabled but not enforced\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. On a server with MFA enabled (but not enforced), such as **rc.test**, sign in with an account using email / password
2. Go to Profile ➜ Security ➜ Multi-factor Authentication ➜ Edit
3. Follow the instructions to enable MFA (mobile apps: verify you can scroll on the MFA setup screen)
4. Logout
5. (RN app testers, do this part on RN apps) Enter credentials to log in
6. Enter \*_incorrect_\* MFA token and verify it doesn't log you in
7. Verify taken back to login page, re-enter credentials (if they're not already filled in)
8. Enter correct MFA token

**Expected**

- Multifactor Authentication is enabled, and login is successful only after entering the MFA code.
