## MM-T406: Sign In Forgot password - Email address not on server (but valid) Focus in login field on login page

---

**Step 1**

\--------------------\
On a server with site URL and email settings configured (such as rc.test.mattermost.com):\
1\. Go to the login page where you enter username & password\
2\. Verify focus is in first login field (N/A for RN)\
3\. Click "I forgot my password"\
4\. Enter an email that doesn't have an account on the server (but that you CAN receive email at)

**Expected**

- User redirected to a page with message
- "If the account exists, a password reset email will be sent to: \[email address]. Please check your inbox."
- Email is not received (presuming site URL and email have been set up on this server; otherwise this test is invalid because email wouldn't be sent even if that email address had an account)
- RN: The first login field is not focused on mobile, this is expected
