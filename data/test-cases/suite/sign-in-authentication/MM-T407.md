## MM-T407: Sign In Forgot password - Email address has account on server

---

**Step 1**

Sign In Forgot password - Email address has account on server\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
On a server with email configured (such as rctesting):

1. Go to the login page where you enter username & password
2. Click "I forgot my password"
3. Enter an email that has an account on the server
4. Go to your email account, find the email sent by Mattermost and click the "Reset password" button
5. Enter a new password
6. Sign in with the account, using the new password

**Expected**

- Log in screen should display "password updated successfully".
- N/A for mobile: The URL should read "/login?extra=password\_change"
- Sign-in is successful
- Note on mobile apps: May not be redirected to the app. Should still be able to reset password and log in.
