## MM-T409: Logging out clears currently logged in user from the store

---

**Step 1**

Logging out clears currently logged in user from the store\
\--------------------\
1\. Login as user A and switch to a different team and channel\
2\. Logout\
3\. Login as user B and switch to a different team and channel\
4\. Logout\
5\. Login as user A again, observe you're viewing the team/channel you switched to in step 1\
6\. Logout\
7\. Login as user B again, observe you're viewing the team/channel you switched to in step 3

**Expected**

Logging out clears that user from the store; other user's last viewed channel should not persist on next user logging in
