## MM-T418: Session expires when the focus is not on the tab (non-mobile)

---

**Step 1**

Session expires when the focus is not on the tab (non-mobile)\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Login to a server using a browser
2. From Account Settings, set your desktop notifications to Never
3. Move the focus to a different server tab (desktop app) or browser tab
4. From a separate browser session, login to the same server as the same user
5. Click the hamburger menu and select Account Settings > Security
6. Click "View and Logout of Active Sessions", then find and close the session created in step 1
7. Wait, without viewing original session app/browser, until you see a desktop notification (may take up to a minute)
8. View the original app/browser tab (can also click the desktop notification to view)

(Cannot Reproduce) [Desktop notification does not fire on killing active session (web mobile narrow view) MM-25802](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-25802)

**Expected**

- Desktop notification is sent (may take up to 1 min) for session expiry, even though other desktop notifications are set to Never
- After step 8, login page shows a message above the login box that the session has expired
