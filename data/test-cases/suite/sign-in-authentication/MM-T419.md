---

**Step 1**

Desktop session expires when the focus is on the tab\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Login to a server using the Native Desktop App
2. From Account Settings, set your desktop notifications to Never (if not already done)
3. From a separate browser session, login to the same server as the same user
4. Click the hamburger menu and select Account Settings ➜ Security
5. Click "View and Logout of Active Sessions", then find and close the session created in step 1
6. Go back and view the original session app/browser, and wait until you see a desktop notification (may take up to a minute)
