---

**Step 1**

Timeout notification will persist\
\--------------------\
1\. Close the browser or client used in steps above that had showed the expiry message\
2\. Reopen the browser or client and select the tab or navigate to the server where your session expired

**Expected**

\- Login page still shows message informing user their session had expired\
\
\- A Desktop notification occurs to draw attention to the timeout
