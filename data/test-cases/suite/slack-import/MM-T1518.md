## MM-T1518: Slack Import

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

---

**Step 1**

Slack Import\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Use the Slack Import file generated from the Smarttotem Slack team
2. Run it through the slack-advanced-exporter (https\://github.com/grundleborg/slack-advanced-exporter) to get the uploaded files and add them to the archive.
3. Ensure "Enable integrations to override usernames" is enabled "True" in the Mattermost System Console.
4. Import slack ( Please see [How to Import Slack](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T1534) )

_Important notes about this step:_

Import of LMs file succeeds (does not contain file attachments)\
\
LI imported the file in the Google Drive linked above (also no file attachments as that one failed)

**Expected**

- Import should be successful.
