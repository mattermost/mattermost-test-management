## MM-T1524: Join / Leave Messages

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Join / Leave Messages\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to the joinleave channel
2. Read through messages

**Expected**

- Join / leave messages are imported, and match the Mattermost style of System Messages.
- For a user who already exists in a channel, the channel should not be marked as unread.
