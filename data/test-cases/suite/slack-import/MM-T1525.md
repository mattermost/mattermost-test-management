## MM-T1525: Links

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Links\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to the "links" channel

2. Check that the links work correctly:

   - email link (ux\@mattermost.com)
   - website autolinks
   - youtube link
   - png image link
   - gif link
   - \#channel links should be converted to \~channel
   - at-mention links (channel-wide mentions are not expected to link, just highlight)

_Important notes about this step:_

Link previews from import are currently not supported.

**Expected**

- The imported links are linked properly.
