## MM-T1528: Slack format for slash command messages

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Slack format for slash command messages\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\
LM: Need to seed Slack import account with an ephemeral message that has an attachment (see [https://github.com/mattermost/platform/pull/4999](http://Slack%20%22posts%22%20are%20not%20imported,%20and%20should%20link%20to%20Slack%20for%20the%20file.)) ?

_Important notes about this step:_

This step is "N/A" on the original spreadsheet and may need to be deleted here.

**Expected**

- Message should be styled like a System Message, and still have attachment
