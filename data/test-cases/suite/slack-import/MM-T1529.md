## MM-T1529: Import the same team twice

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

---

**Step 1**

Import the same team twice\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a Mattermost team
2. Import a Slack Export into that team ( Please see [How to Import Slack](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T1534) )
3. Check that the Import Summary produced doesn't show any issues
4. Check that the channels were created and the imported users were added to them
5. Repeat steps 1-4 above on the same server (creating a new Mattermost team, but using the same Slack archive)

**Expected**

- The second import should be successful.
