## MM-T1530: Import a Slack Account with a taken email address

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

---

**Step 1**

Import a Slack Account with a taken email address\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. The Slack team has an account with the `bot\@mattermost.com` address
2. Import the Slack team to rc.test server, which has an existing `bot\@mattermost.com` account ( Please see [How to Import Slack](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T1534) )

**Expected**

- In the import summary, it says the account was merged with the existing account.
