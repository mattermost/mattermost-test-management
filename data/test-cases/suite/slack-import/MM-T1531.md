## MM-T1531: Import Slack users with no email address

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

**Step 1**

Import Slack users with no email address\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Import the "Twalk1team+Slack+export+Feb+9+2017-2.zip" from the Google drive link at the top of this tab

(The .zip file is also attached to <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-5735>)

_Important notes about this step:_

(the email address imported is @localhost)

**Expected**

- For now, users are created with fake email address username\@example.com
