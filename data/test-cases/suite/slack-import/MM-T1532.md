## MM-T1532: Import Slack channel with name matching deleted Mattermost channel

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

---

**Step 1**

Import Slack channel with name matching deleted Mattermost channel\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a new Mattermost team with any new channel name.
2. Delete the channel.
3. In Slack, create a channel with the exact same name.
4. Export the Slack team, then import it into Mattermost. ( Please see [How to Import Slack](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T1534) )

_Important notes about this step:_

(tested archiving one of the imported channels, then importing again and checking the URL of the channel)

**Expected**

- New imported channel should have a randomly generated ID as its handle (URL).
