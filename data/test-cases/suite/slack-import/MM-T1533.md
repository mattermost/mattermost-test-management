## MM-T1533: Claim a Slack Imported account

**Precondition**

Slack Import test files are kept [in Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19y2KC_tcqJZa-BDucvpdmsNdBqy-UL8Q)\
You will use the above files for the tests.\
It is important you have an account on the Slack team before exporting, so you can test claiming a Mattermost account imported from Slack.

---

**Step 1**

Claim a Slack Imported account\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Go to the Mattermost site sign in page
2. Click "I forgot my password"
3. Enter an email address for an account imported from Slack
4. Reset the password and login
5. Check that the account belongs to the correct channels
6. Open a Direct Message channel, and post a message

_Important notes about this step:_

This step read "_Not sure about this one?_" on the original spreadsheet and may need to be deleted.

**Expected**

- Account has been added to the channels they belonged to in Slack.
- They can send Direct Messages to other users.
