## MM-T899: Edition and License: Verify Privacy Policy link points to correct URL

---

**Step 1**

**Note**: We don't currently test anything on this page, but removing and re-adding a license is included in other tests

1. Click on the Privacy Policy link at the bottom of System Console ➜ Edition & License 
2. Verify the link points to `https://mattermost.com/privacy-policy/`

**Expected**

- The Privacy Policy link in System Console ➜ Edition & License should link to `https://mattermost.com/privacy-policy/`
