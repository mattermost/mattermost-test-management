## MM-T3829: Expired License upload

---

**Step 1**

Expired License upload\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Log into this server ➜ <https://mattermost-server-pr-16787.test.mattermost.cloud> (standard Spinwick credentials)
2. Go to [System Console ➜ About ➜ Edition and License](https://mattermost-server-pr-16787.test.mattermost.cloud/admin_console/about/license) and remove any license that might already be in place there
3. Download the [Already expired.mattermost-license](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxksU73Wm64SxwV6D3T-2J1Yx13wGy6r/view?usp=sharing) file and upload it to the server

**Expected**

- The license fails to upload or apply
- An error is displayed telling you it's expired
