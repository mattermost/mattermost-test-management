## MM-T1169: Compliance Export - CSV export 10 posts

---

**Step 1**

Compliance Export - CSV\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As system admin, go to System Console > Compliance > Compliance Export
2. Set Enable Compliance Export to true
3. Select the CSV export format and Save
4. Go back to a team and post 10 messages (this is because if there hasn't been an export job run on this server yet, it may only export messages after the export was enabled, not before)
5. Go back to system console, click to run export job now
6. Verify in job table that it says In Progress, then Success and also shows a number of messages exported (if this was the first job on the server, this should match the number of messages you posted in step 4, if it is more, that's okay too (probably had previously been enabled))

_Important notes about this step:_

CLOUD: Only test the number of records exported in UI -- no access to cloud local path

**Expected**

- If you have access, could also verify that the compliance export `.csv` files have saved to the local file path `./data/exports`
- **In UI**: Verify a number of exported records displays in Details column (may or may not match how many you posted in step 4)
