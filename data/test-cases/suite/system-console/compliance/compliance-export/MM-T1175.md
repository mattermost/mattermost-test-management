## MM-T1175: Compliance Export: Bot UserType identifies that the message is posted by a bot

---

**Step 1**

Identify that the message is posted by a bot\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Add a bot user
2. Make that bot post a message
3. Post a message as regular user
4. Perform compliance export for CSV, Actiance and GlobalRelay

_Related ticket(s):_

(**Story**) [Add an identifier for compliance exports when a message is posted by a bot account — MM-14721](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14721)

_Important notes about this step:_

For cloud testing, only able to verify compliance export for GlobalRelay. Don't have access to csv and actiance

**Test Data**

Create bot user in Integrations, Postman:\
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"channel\_id":"wktut4j8fjrm9jorug4zz67sfw", "message":"This is a message from a bot", "props":{"attachments": \[{"pretext": "Look some text","text": "This is text"}]}}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer qxkbhqzemf8ptffpti7b88a1cy' https\://rc.test.mattermost.com/api/v4/posts

**Expected**

- Validate the field 'UserType' is present and is set to 'bot' or 'user' accordingly
