## MM-T3305: Verify Deactivated users are displayed properly in Compliance Exports

---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as system admin and create a private channel.\
2\. Add user-1 to the channel.\
3\. Post a message from system admin, or user-1, or both.\
4\. Deactivate user-1, doesnâ€™t matter how.\
5\. Run an Actiance compliance export.\
Observe that user-1 is present in the list of channel members in the XML output.\
6\. Have system admin post in the channel again.\
7\. Run another Actiance export.\
Observer that user-1 is not present in the list of channel members in the XML.\
8\. Re-activate user-1.\
9\. Post a message from system admin, or user-1, or both.\
10\. Run an Actiance compliance export.\
Observe that user-1 is present in the list of channel members in the XML output.

_Important notes about this step:_

For cloud testing, only able to verify compliance export for GlobalRelay. Don't have access to csv and actiance

**Expected**

Deactivated users should not be listed in the compliance export if message was posted after they were deactivated.
