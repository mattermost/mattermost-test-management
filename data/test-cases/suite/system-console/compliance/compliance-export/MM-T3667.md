## MM-T3667: Download Compliance Export File - Only User with permission should download compliance export

---

**Step 1**

1\. Ensure the DownloadExportResults config is set to true in config.json and restart the server.\
2\. Login as System Admin and trigger a compliance export for CSV and ensure some messages are exported.\
3\. Now login as System Manager and notice that there is no option to view Compliance Exports.\
4\. Now trigger the following API:\
/api/v4/jobs/type/message\_export?page=0\&per\_page=50\
5\. This will return the ID of the exported file which can be downloaded.\
6\. Now access the following API from the browser:\
/api/v4/jobs/\<JOB\_ID>/download

**Expected**

System User should not be able to download and following Json message should show up,\\

```
"message":"You do not have the appropriate permissions."
```
