## MM-T3945: Compliance Export - Global Relay export 10 posts

---

**Step 1**

Compliance Export - Global Relay\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Same steps as above, but fill in Global Relay settings (from LastPass secure note)
2. Then post 10 messages in any team, including at least one DM and at least one attachment
3. Back to System Console and click to run an export job now
4. Log in to Global Relay (creds in LastPass secure note)
5. May have to wait several minutes, but at some point, a new entry for today's date should appear at the top of the list, with 10 messages in it

- (**Story**) [Increase Global Relay max email size from 100MB to 250MiB. — MM-10947](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10947)

_Important notes about this step:_

- After test is done, remove Global Relay username, password, and email address and set back to false
- Not sure how much we're going to test each release. Original tickets linked above.

**Expected**

- Test Global Relay specifically, including output? It can take several minutes for the export to appear in Global Relay. Just keep clicking the search icon to refresh results, until you see messages with today's date at the top of the list
- Verify any DMs and attachments are included (added v5.13 after reading a thread asking about this and realizing we don't test it)
