## MM-T1179: License levels ➜ Compliance monitoring options available for E10

---

**Step 1**

License levels --> Compliance monitoring options available for E10\
\--------------------\
Add E10 license\
System Console > Compliance > Compliance Monitoring

_Related ticket(s):_

- (**Story**) [Display only licensed settings on Compliance Monitoring page — MM-15346](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-15346)
- [License page sometimes appears with NaN fields — MM-17917](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17917)

**Test Data**

NEW 5.12\
MM-15346\
FIXED 5.15 https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17917

**Expected**

\- E10 should see only "User Activity Logs" on "Compliance Monitoring" page\
\- No "NaN" type fields should be seen while license is loading and there should be no refresh after license is uploaded (this last one can be moved eventually to its own license section; it's not Compliance-specific)
