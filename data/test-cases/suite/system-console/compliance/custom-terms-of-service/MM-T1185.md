## MM-T1185: Custom Terms of Service - Markdown, long text

---

**Step 1**

With "Enable Custom Terms of Service" = "True"\
\\

1. Copy the markdown text in the test data field to the right and post it into the custom ToS text box
2. Set a renewal period
3. Click "Save"
4. Observe the page switches to TOS page automatically
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page then scroll back to the top, buttons always visible (Se doesn't do this part but has a note for verifying visually if we want to; that's okay)
