## MM-T1200: RN apps: Custom TOS - MFA required, user without MFA set up logs in, sets up MFA, agrees to new Terms of Service

**Precondition**

**Skip until fixed (blocked by **[**MM-13547**](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13547)**)**

---

**Step 1**

**\*\*\* ENSURE your system admin has MFA set up BEFORE you make it required on the server! \*\*\***\
**Just to repeat this**:

1. With your system admin account, go to Account Settings ➜ Security ➜ MFA and set up MFA on your system admin account FIRST
2. Then enforce MFA: System Console ➜ Authentication ➜ MFA
3. Enable or update existing terms of service
4. Login with a user that has neither setup MFA nor agreed to the terms of service

**Test Data**

This one is not for RN, seems like; on RN you see error "Multi-factor authentication is required on this server" and have to set up MFA on webapp\

**Skip until fixed (blocked by **[**MM-13547**](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13547)**)**\

Unable to load terms of service. If this issue persists, contact your System Administrator.

**Expected**

- MFA prompt
- Terms of Service are shown after MFA setup
