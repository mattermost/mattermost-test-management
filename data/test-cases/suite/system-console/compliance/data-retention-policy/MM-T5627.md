---

**Step 1**

1\. Login as System Admin\
2\. Enable /test commands\
3\. Open any channel\
4\. Create posts that are older than 1 hour ex: _/test posts images=3 time=1726147464000_ (based on you current time) but less than 1 day old\
5\. Make some post that are not backdated ex: _/test posts images=3_\
6\. Navigate to _Data Retention_ in the system console\
7\. Set a global policy to have all attachments deleted within 1 hour\
8\. Remove any global policy for deleting posts\
9\. Click _Run Deletion Job Now_ to run data retention job\
10\. Ensure the job completes successfully\
11\. Return to the user side and refresh the webapp OR login again in a new browser session

**Expected**

11.1 In the channel from step _3._ the attachments on the backdated posts should be deleted\
11.2 In the channel from step _3._ the posts themselves should remain\
11.3 In the channel from step _3._ the posts that are not backdated should still have their attachments in place
