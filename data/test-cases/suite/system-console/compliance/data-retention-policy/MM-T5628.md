**Step 1**

1\. Login as System Admin\
2\. Enable /test commands\
3\. Open any channel\
4\. Create posts that are older than 1 hour ex: _/test posts range=10 time=1726147464000_ (based on you current time) but less than 1 day old\
5\. Make some post that are not backdated ex: _/test posts range=10_\
6\. Navigate to _Data Retention_ in the system console\
7\. Set a global policy to have all posts deleted within 1 hour\
8\. Click _Run Deletion Job Now_ to run data retention job\
9\. Ensure the job completes successfully\
10\. Return to the user side and refresh the webapp OR login again in a new browser session

10.2 In the channel from step _3._ the posts that are not backdated should still be in the channel\\
