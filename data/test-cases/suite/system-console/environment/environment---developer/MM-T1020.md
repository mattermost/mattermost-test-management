## MM-T1020: Developer - Testing Commands false

---

**Step 1**

Developer - Testing Commands false\
\--------------------\
1\. Set "Enable Testing Commands" to false\
2\. Save\
3\. Go to a team, post `/test` + Enter

**Expected**

Typing "/test" + Enter will not post a message, shows error "Command with a trigger of '/test' not found. Click here to send as a message."\
(Se also tests that clicking that help text posts /test as a message)
