## MM-T4045: Session length not extended with email login when ExtendSessionLengthWithActivity is disabled

---

**Step 1**

When disabled, it should not extend even with user activity.\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. At system admin console, disable "Extend session length with activity" and remain "Session Length AD/LDAP and Email (days)" to 1.
2. Login, visit a channel and post a message.
3. Wait for 15 minutes then go back and make a second post.
4. Wait for 24 hours then go back.

**Test Data**

On 3, note the timestamp.

**Expected**

User session should\*\* \*\*have expired at the 24th hour mark even with a user activity of post made in step 3.
