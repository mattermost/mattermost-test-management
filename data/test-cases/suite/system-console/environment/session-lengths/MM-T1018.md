## MM-T1018: Session lengths - Idle timeout

---

**Step 1**

Session lengths - Idle timeout\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Set idle timeout to 5 minutes and save
2. Log another user in to the server on another browser and start a timer
3. Leave that browser untouched until at least 5+ minutes

**Expected**

- After some time (depends on when the server is checking for activity; could be <1 minute or more like 9), the untouched browser should automatically be logged out
- Desktop/browsers see notification (desktop notification, asterisk in browser tab, message on login page "Your session has expired. Please log in again.")
- Set back to 0 (unlimited) after test is done (or whatever it had been set to before. postgres.test is often set to 1440 but could make it 14400)
