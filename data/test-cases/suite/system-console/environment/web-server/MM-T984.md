## MM-T984: Subpath - Change subpath, restart server

---

**Step 1**

Probably don't need to test this, but for reference:

1. Start with no configured subpath

2. Configure a /subpath

3. Verify that site continues to function without /subpath

4. Restart the server and browse to /subpath

   - command to restart server is `sudo systemctl restart mattermost` (from /mattermost directory)

5. Verify the site functions with /subpath (and no longer serves directly at /)

6. Configure /subpath2

7. Verify that the site continues to function with /subpath

8. Restart the server

9. Verify the site functions with /subpath2 (and no longer serves directly at / or /subpath)

**Expected**

<---------- As described in the steps
