## MM-T1202: Read-only Town Square

---

**Step 1**

Read-only Town Square\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As a _NON-system admin account_, in a read-only Town Square (such as [Reception on community-release.mattermost.com](https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/town-square) Contributors team):
2. View a post that already has emoji reaction(s) on it, such as <https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/pl/jo5i4h33wiy1ueowstyerco9sa>
3. Hover over the reaction, verify no plus sign appears
4. Click existing reaction, verify it does not add that reaction from you
5. Click reply icon to open RHS, verify on hover no plus and clicking existing reaction has no action
6. Open the post in **RN app**, verify tapping existing reaction has no action, tapping emoji from picker to add reaction has no action, long-press on any post in read-only channel does not show option to add reaction

**Expected**

- Verify as described in steps (summarized below):

  - Can't click or tap existing reaction to add one from yourself
  - No plus sign on hover over reactions
  - No reaction option on long-press on RN apps
  - Same in RHS as in center

- On **RN App**, post draft should look similar to below (greyed out and contains reading glasses icon)
