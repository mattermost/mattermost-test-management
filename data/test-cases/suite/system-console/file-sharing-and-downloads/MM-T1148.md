## MM-T1148: Webapp: Disable File Uploads on Mobile (E20)

---

**Step 1**

Allow File Uploads on Mobile\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Allow file sharing = true
2. Allow file uploads on mobile = false

_Related ticket(s):_

[System Console: Allow Mobile upload/download files options should be hidden on a non E-20 server — MM-16073](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16073)

_Important notes about this step:_

LM didn't realize these were E20 settings only; need to refine the tests here....\
\
But the settings appear on non-E20 and have no effect. :/\
<https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-16073> - fixed v5.13

**Expected**

**Browser in mobile view**:

- Attachment icon is visible and works

**Browser or desktop in full view**:

- Attachment icon is visible and works

**_Mobile app_** _:_

- There's a separate test case for Mobile found here [MM-T3453](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/projects/MM?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin%3Acom.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/testCase/MM-T3453)
