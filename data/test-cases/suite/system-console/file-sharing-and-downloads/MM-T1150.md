## MM-T1150: Allow File Downloads on Mobile (E20)

---

**Step 1**

Allow File Downloads on Mobile\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. View a file attachment on mobile apps, verify Download option is available
2. In System Console, set Allow File Downloads on Mobile to false
3. Go back to mobile apps and view file attachments again

_Important notes about this step:_

LM didn't realize these were E20 settings only; need to refine the tests here....\
\
Also, see if team test item is redundant and remove one or the other (Elias filed bug to hide settings for non-E20; need to work that into tests)

**Expected**

- Option to Download is not there
