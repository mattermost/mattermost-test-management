## MM-T1151: Access Tokens - Enable, can create: system admin, warning messaging

---

**Step 1**

Access Tokens - Enable, can create: system admin, warning messaging\
\--------------------\
Enable personal access tokens in System Console > Integration Management\
As system admin or a user who has had access tokens enabled by system admin in Users > Roles:\
Go to Account Settings > Security > Personal Access Tokens > Edit > Create\
Enter a description, click Save (System admin will also see here a confirmation "You are generating a personal access token with System Admin permissions. Are you sure want to create this token?"; click Yes, Create)\
Press ESC to close the modal

**Expected**

On trying to navigate away, confirmation modal displays: "Make sure you have copied and saved the access token below. You won't be able to see it again!" plus the token, and a button that says "Yes, I have copied the token"
