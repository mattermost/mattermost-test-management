## MM-T1155: Access Tokens - Disable own token

---

**Step 1**

Access Tokens - Disable own token\
\--------------------\
In Account Settings > Security > Personal Access Tokens, create a new token, click through confirmation modal(s)\
Click Edit next to Personal Access Tokens\
Click Disable under a token\
Check that user in System Console > Users > Manage Tokens, verify the disabled token is still listed (refresh to be sure accurate)

**Expected**

For the token user: Disable changes the button to say Enable and shows `(Disabled)` after the token description (still appears in System Console token list for that user)
