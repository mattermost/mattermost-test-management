## MM-T902: Reporting ➜ Site statistics line graphs show same date

---

**Step 1**

On [rc.test.mattermost.com](https://rc.test.mattermost.com/)\
\
**Note**: You will do most of the rest of this tab's tests on [postgres.test](https://postgres.test.mattermost.com) but this one is best on rc.test:\\

1. View "Site Statistics" (under Reporting)

_Related ticket(s):_

- [Reporting > Site Statistics: Line graphs show different dates — MM-19242](http://19https%3A//mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-242)
- [System Console > Site Statistics - Dates are displayed out of order for days when there are no posts — MM-23782](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-23782)

**Expected**

- Scroll down, verify the three line graphs have the same dates

(i.e. "Total Posts", "Total Posts from Bots" & "Active Users with Posts")
