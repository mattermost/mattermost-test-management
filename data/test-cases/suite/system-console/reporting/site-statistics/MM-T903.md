## MM-T903: Site Statistics > Deactivating a user increments the Daily and Monthly Active Users counts down

---

**Step 1**

As system admin on a server that has active users (and at least one user you can deactivate), view System Console ➜ Site Statistics\
Make note of the following values:

1. Total Active Users
2. Daily Active Users
3. Monthly Active Users
4. Go to Users and deactivate a user (user should have been active today and this month in order for "Daily" and "Monthly" active users to increment down)
5. Go back to Site Statistics

_Related ticket(s):_

[Deactivating a user should increment the Daily and Monthly Active Users counts down (not up) in System Console — MM-19957](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-19957)

**Expected**

- After 3) All three counts increment down
