**Step 1**

1. Change Account Settings ➜ Display ➜ Language to Français
2. View System Console ➜ Site Statistics (the first page)

- In \_most \_cases, titles in the "cards" (boxes across the top) should fit without being truncated.

- The following titles will truncate as they are just too long to be displayed:

  - Nombre total de comma...
  - Connexions bases de do...
  - Connexions bases de do...
