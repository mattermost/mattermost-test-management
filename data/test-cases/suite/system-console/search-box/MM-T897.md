## MM-T897: Focus should be in System Console search box on opening System Console or refreshing pages in System Console

---

**Step 1**

Focus should be in System Console search box on opening System Console or refreshing pages in System Console\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––\\

1. Main menu ➜ System Console, observe focus is in search box
2. Navigate to another page such as Site Statistics, observe focus is \*not\* in search box
3. Refresh, observe focus is back in search box
4. Spot-check on 4 or 5 additional pages

_Important notes about this step:_

On the Server Logs page, refreshing briefly puts focus in search box, then focus switches to the Logs table (it has always been expected that focus is on the table on opening this page, but refresh behavior possibly should be changed to be consistent with other pages.

**Expected**

- Focus in search box on first opening System Console, and on refreshing on any page

**Step 2**

System Console menu footer should not cut off at the bottom\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Scroll to the bottom of the LHS System Console menu
2. Observe the last item on the bottom of the menu
