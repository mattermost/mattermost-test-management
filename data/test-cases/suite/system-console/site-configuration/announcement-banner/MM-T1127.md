## MM-T1127: Announcement Banner - One user doesn't dismiss it for another user

---

**Step 1**

Announcement Banner - One user doesn't dismiss it for another user\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Set "Enable Announcement Banner:" to true
2. Enter text in "Banner Text:" field
3. Use color pickers to change banner and text color
4. Leave "Allow Banner Dismissal:" set to true
5. Save
6. Also view as another user in different browser / desktop app
7. One user: dismiss by clicking X
8. Other user: refresh

_Important notes about this step:_

This might be one we could cull; is the simultaneous multi-browser necessary?

**Expected**

- Both users see banner containing expected text, colors match settings, banner overlaps content at top of page
- One user dismissing doesn't dismiss for other user
