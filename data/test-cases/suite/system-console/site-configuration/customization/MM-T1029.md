## MM-T1029: Custom branding text can render markdown text

**Objective**

**NOTE: CUSTOM EMOJI DO NOT RENDER IN CUSTOM BRANDING TEXT - STILL TO BE IMPLEMENTED: https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-12657**

---

**Step 1**

1. Set "Enable Custom Branding" to "true"
2. Copy the text attached in the test data field to the right into the branding text box
3. Save
4. Logout

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- The custom branding text - including the emoji - should display on the login page
- Ensure line breaks render in the markdown text.
