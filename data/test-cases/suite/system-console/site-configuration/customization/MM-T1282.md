## MM-T1282: Customization ➜ Site Name help text matches text field behavior

---

**Step 1**

1. Go to System Console ➜ Site Configuration ➜ Customization ➜ Site Name
   \
   <https://postgres.test.mattermost.com/admin_console/site_config/customization>
2. If Site Name has "Mattermost", change it to something else (eg. ABC)
3. Save it, and verify that ABC now appears for site name in the hamburger menu as "About ABC", in the About modal, in login screen.
4. Notice that the help text for Site Name says '... When not specified, it defaults to "Mattermost"'.
5. Delete the site name, leave it blank and save.
