## MM-T1136: Emoji Picker - False

---

**Step 1**

Emoji Picker - False\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Set `Enable Emoji Picker` to `false`

_Related ticket(s):_

Note there is a ticket to remove this setting from System Console entirely: [v6.0: Remove the emoji picker system console setting — MM-11671](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-11671)

_Important notes about this step:_

Expected that it does not disable in RN apps on long-press.

**Expected**

- Emoji picker icon does not appear on:

  - Message box in center or RHS or
  - Reactions on messages in center or RHS

- If a post already has a reaction, the `+` to add another reaction does not appear on hover

- If a post already has a reaction, the user can click it to add/remove their reaction that way

- Emoji can still be added by typing :emojiname: or reactions by typing +:emojiname:
