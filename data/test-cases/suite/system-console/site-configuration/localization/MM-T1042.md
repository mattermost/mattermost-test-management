\--------------------\
1\. If there are any set, remove all languages from "Available Languages" from the dropdown and "Save"\
2\. Go to Account settings and verify the available languages can be selected from Display > Language\
3\. Go back to the system console and manually only add English and "Save"\
4\. Go back to Account settings and verify English is the only language that can be selected from Display > Language

**Expected**

The languages available in Account Settings should be the same ones set in the system console.
