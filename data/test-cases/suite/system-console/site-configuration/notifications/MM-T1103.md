## MM-T1103: Users and Teams - Disable confirmation for special mentions

---

**Step 1**

Users and Teams - Disable confirmation for special mentions\
\--------------------\
Add a system console setting to disable the "Confirm sending notifications to entire channel" modal.\
Below the setting "Max Notifications Per Channel" in System Console > General > Users and Teams add the following setting:\
Show @channel and @all confirmation dialog: \[ x ] true \[ ] false\
Help text: "When true, users will be prompted to confirm when posting @channel and @all in channels with over five members. When false, no confirmation is required."

**Test Data**

SETTING MOVED TO PUSH NOTIFICATIONS SETTINGS v5.12 , but due to data setup this is still tested in sc11-UsersTeamsMaxes.html

**Expected**

When true, users will be prompted to confirm when posting @channel and @all in channels with over five members. When false, no confirmation is required.
