## MM-T1112: Notification Settings Email Customized name, address, etc

---

**Step 1**

Notification Settings\
Email\
Customized name, address, etc\
\--------------------\
Set "Notification Display Name:" = Edited Mattermost\
Set "Notification From Address:" = edited-feedback\@mattermost.com (make sure whatever you edit it to is still in valid email address format; I added an extra `m` to the end once and it couldn't connect, but it wasn't obvious why)\
Set "Notification Footer Mailing Address:" = "Mattermost, 12345 test avenue, City, 90210"\
Save\
Send an email notification by mentioning your account with another test account

**Expected**

Email notification received is from the name and email address specified, and the email has the correct footer address.\
\
\
\
FYI defaults to re-set to:\
Display Name: Feedback MM-postgres.test\
From Address: feedback\@mattermost.com\
Mailing Address: {blank}
