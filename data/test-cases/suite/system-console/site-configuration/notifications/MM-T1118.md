**Step 1**

Notification Settings Email - With setting set to Never\
\--------------------\

1. Open Settings > Notifications
2. Click "Edit" to the right of "Email Notifications"
3. Select "Never"
4. Click "Save"
5. Have another user send some mentions and DMs, then put the app/server in the background and don't touch it for at least 15 minutes :)
6. Check your email after 15 min
