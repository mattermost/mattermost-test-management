## MM-T1121: Notification Settings Mobile Push - DM, sender name only

---

**Step 1**

Notification Settings\
Mobile Push - DM, sender name only\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As an Admin go to System Console ➜ Site Configuration ➜ Notifications
2. Set "Push Notification Contents" to "Generic description with only sender name"
3. Set the test account to away, if notifications are set to fire when away or offline
4. Log in to the test account on your mobile device, and put mobile app in background
5. Send a direct message to the test account

_Important notes about this step:_

- Test all of these on iOS and Android (can have them both logged in and observe notifications at the same time)
- If you're still viewing the app on your mobile device, you'll see \*desktop notifications\*, which follow separate settings

**Expected**

- DM push notification is received in the form of "\[other user] sent you a message"

---

**Step 2**

1. Verify push message as described ➜
2. Send an at-mention to the account

**Expected**

- Mention push notification shows title "Mattermost" (not the channel name)

Body appears as "\[other user] mentioned you."
