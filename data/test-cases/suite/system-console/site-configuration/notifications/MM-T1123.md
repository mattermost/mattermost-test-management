## MM-T1123: Notification Settings Mobile Push - DM and mention, sender name and channel name

---

**Step 1**

Notification Settings\
Mobile Push - DM and mention, sender name and channel name\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. As an Admin go to System Console ➜ Site Configuration ➜ Notifications
2. Set "Push Notification Contents" to "Generic description with sender and channel names"
3. Log in to a test account on your mobile device, and put mobile app in background
4. Set the test account to away, if notifications are set to fire when away or offline
5. Send a direct message to the test account
6. Verify push message
7. Send an at-mention to the account

_Important notes about this step:_

If you're still viewing the app on your mobile device, you'll see _desktop notifications_, which follow separate settings

**Expected**

- DM push notification is received in the form of "\[other user] sent you a message" (title is the other user, same as when set to show sender name only, since a DM's channel name is the other user)
- Mention push notification shows the channel name as the title
- Body appears as "username mentioned you."
