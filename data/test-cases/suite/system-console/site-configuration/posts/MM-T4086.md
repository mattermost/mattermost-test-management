## MM-T4086: Disable Link Previews from certain domains

---

**Step 1**

Disable Link Previews from certain domains\
\--------------------------------------------\\

1. Set "Enable Link Previews" to "true"

2. In the next field "Disable link previews from these domains:" enter a domain you are trying to block\
   e.g. youtube.com you can add multiple domains separated by comma

3. Save

4. Return to a team

5. Ensure Account Settings>Display>WebsiteLink Previews is set to ON

6. In any channel, post a link from youtube or any other domain you added to blocked list in step 2.

   1. Verify link posts, but preview is not available 

7. Post a link from any other, non-blocked domain e.g. github.com

   1. Verify posted link shows preview as expected.

**Expected**

- Verify link preview is not available for disabled links
- Verify all other link previews still display as expected
