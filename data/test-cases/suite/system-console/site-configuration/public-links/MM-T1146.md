## MM-T1146: Public Links disabled

---

**Step 1**

Public Links disabled\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. System Console ➜ Site Configuration ➜ Public Links ➜ Set "Enable Public File Link" = false
2. Save
3. Open a file or image preview

v5.32 (February 2021) [Settings are not saved on System Console > Site Configuration > Public Links — MM-32255](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-32255)

_Important notes about this step:_

Basic UI tests in Se; actual file downloads in manual tests

**Expected**

- "Get Public Link" should be hidden in the image preview UI
- Can still click "Download" to download the file
