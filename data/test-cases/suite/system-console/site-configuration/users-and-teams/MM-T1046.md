## MM-T1046: Max Users per Team: Can't use invite link over max

---

**Step 1**

Max Users per Team\
\--------------------\
1\. Set Max Users to number of users on the current team, Save\
2\. Have a user not on the team try to join the team using an invite link

**Test Data**

Won't fix (when max no. is reduced to fewer than current users on team, no need to notify in real time): https\://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-4091

**Expected**

User sees error message below the Create Button on trying to save new account info: "This team has reached the maximum number of allowed accounts. Contact your systems administrator to set a higher limit."
