## MM-T1053: Restrict users to open Direct Message channels with users they share a team with: Open new DM

---

**Step 1**

Restrict users to open Direct Message channels with users they share a team with - More...\
\--------------------\
Note: Ensure there are multiple teams, and you can identify two users on the server who are on different teams; not on any same team together (or create a new user on one team, and Se-IDEntify a user who isn't on that team but is on the same server)\
\
1\. In System Console > Users and Teams, set "Enable users to open Direct Message channels" to "Any member of the team"\
2\. Identify a pair of users on the server who are not on any team together\
3\. Log out as admin and log in as one of the users you identified\
4\. In the LHS, click the top `+` to find a new channel, then click Open a New Direct Message (old sidebar was: Direct Messages > More)\
5\. View the user list (can type the beginning of the other user's name to narrow it down)

**Expected**

​​​​User1 who is not on any team with user2 should not see user2 appear on the DM list.\
