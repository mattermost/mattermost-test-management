## MM-T1057: Teammate Name Display: Set up users for tests

---

**Step 1**

Teammate Name Display: Set up users for tests\
\--------------------\
Setup: Have five other users on a team set up as follows. As you log in to each user's account to change their settings, post a message from that account.\
a. Username only\
b. First and last name set (no nickname)\
c. Nickname (no first or last name)\
d. First name only (no last name or nickname)\
e. First and last and nickname

**Expected**

Confirmed (and fixed) in v5.4: Any change to Account Settings overrides (and continues to override) System Console setting.\
\
So the Se test has been adjusted 10/9/18 5.5 release testing to:\
1\. Verify each System Console setting behaves as expected, BEFORE the user who is viewing makes any changes to their Account Settings setting\
2\. Verify when the user changes Account Settings setting, that setting is honored (and the System Console settings is overriden)\
3\. Verify if System Console changes after user changed their setting, the user sees no change\
4\. Verify (just for fun) that if the user changes their setting to match System Console, all display as expected\
\
Update test steps listed here in spreadsheet to reflect the changes
