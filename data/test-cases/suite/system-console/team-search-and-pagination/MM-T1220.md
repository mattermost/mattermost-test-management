**Step 1**

Can search for Teams\
–––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Login as sysadmin and visit the page\
   /admin\_console/user\_management/teams
2. Search for different team names and check if results are displayed correctly

_Related ticket(s):_

- [Deleted team still shows up in admin\_console/user\_management/teams](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-35451)

**Expected**

- Should be allowed to search for teams and results should appear correctly.
- Results should not include Deleted Teams.
- Pagination count should not consider Deleted Teams

---

**Step 2**

1. Click on a team to see the Team Configuration details

**Expected**

- Page styling has everything aligned properly
