## MM-T915: Manage Users on Server - User filter works and clears

---

**Step 1**

1. View Reporting âžœ Users
2. Use search box filter to locate a user you have logged in in another browser
3. Clear filter and use search box filter together with team drop-down filter

**Expected**

- Filter works as expected to locate user
- All users show again when search box cleared
- Drop-down filters by team, and search box still works when filtered by team
