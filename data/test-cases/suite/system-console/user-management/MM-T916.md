## MM-T916: Changing user role is reflected in UI for admin

---

**Step 1**

1. Click drop-down next to a user and select Manage Roles
2. Change user's level from member to admin or vice versa

**Expected**

- System admin sees System Console
- Team admin sees Team Settings (not System Console)
- Non-admin sees neither System Console nor Team Settings
