## MM-T917: User on no team is returned with no-team filter and with no filter

---

**Step 1**

1. Click drop-down next to a user who is only on one team
2. Select Manage Teams
3. Click Remove From Team next to the team name
4. Observe team is removed from modal; close modal
5. Clear user search filters, observe user is listed
6. Click Team drop-down and select No Teams

**Expected**

- Team no longer listed in modal after removal
- User is still returned in user search with and without no-team filter

(Se also verifies that new system admin role is still reflected after not on any team)
