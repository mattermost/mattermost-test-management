## MM-T922: Demoted user cannot continue to view System Console

---

**Step 1**

1. Log in on another / incognito browser as another user (we'll call them user2) who is also a system admin (can temporarily promote to admin if needed)
2. Have user2 view any page in System Console
3. As your own system admin user, go to Users and locate user2 in the list
4. Click the dropdown next to user2 and select Manage Roles
5. Click Member to demote user2

**Expected**

In other browser, user2 is redirected to Town Square (nearly immediately) and no longer sees System Console in main menu
