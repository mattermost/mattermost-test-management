## MM-T946: GM: User deactivated in System Console still displays

---

**Step 1**

**As system admin**:

1. On desktop app or browser: Open a GM channel with 3 users
2. Observe the channel name in the LHS and note which user is listed first (alpha order)
3. Also open a DM with that first-listed user, and post a message that includes a word you'll be able to search on easily (to verify included in search results)
4. Open a separate browser (still as that system admin), open System Console ➜ Users, deactivate that first-listed user you sent the DM to
5. In first browser/desktop app, view channel list in LHS, verify as described ➜
6. Search for the word you know will return the DM, verify as described ➜

(Won't Fix) [LHS Displayed Name for Group Message is not the first username alphabetically — MM-10115](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10115)

**Expected**

After 5,

- Deactivated user's name continues to display as part of the GM channel name
- Channel names do not change their alphabetical positions in LHS
- DM with that user has an archive icon instead of the user icon in the LHS (if there was no refresh; if refreshed or navigated away and back, the deactivated user's DM may be removed from the LHS)

After 6,

- The post in the DM with the deactivated user is still returned in search results
