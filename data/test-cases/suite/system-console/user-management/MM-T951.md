## MM-T951: Reopened DM with deactivated user shows archived icon in LHS, No status indicator in channel header, Message input replaced with messaging

---

**Step 1**

1\. Open a DM with a user and post a couple messages\
2\. Deactivate that user in System Console > Users\
3\. Back to a team, use channel switcher to find that DM and reopen it

**Expected**

\- Reopened DM shows archived icon in LHS\
\- No status indicator in channel header\
\- Message box replaced with `You are viewing an archived channel with a deactivated user. New messages cannot be posted` in center and RHS
