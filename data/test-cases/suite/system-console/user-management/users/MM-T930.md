## MM-T930: Users - Change a user's email address, with verification on

---

**Step 1**

1. Other user creates account, logs in
2. System admin changes other user's email address (this does not log them out, but the system does send them an email notifying them that "You" - as in the person themselves - updated their own email address). See MM-14454 for more details.
3. User logs out and can still log in with old email address until they click the verification link in the email

- [Implement confirmation modal for System Admin when changing a user's email address via the System Console — MM-14455](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14455)

**Expected**

- User can log in after verification, and also receives email confirmation that email address has been changed
