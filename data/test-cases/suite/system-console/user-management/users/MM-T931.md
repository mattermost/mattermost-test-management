## MM-T931: Users - Can't update a user's email address if user has other signin method

---

**Step 1**

1. In Users list, locate users who have as their signin method:
2. OAuth (GitLab, Office365, Google)
3. LDAP
4. SAML (OKTA, OneLogin) and verify ----->

**Expected**

- Drop-down shows option to switch to email/password login, rather than being able to update email or password

(If you're looking for a user who has another sign-in method, "lindy.isherwood" uses Office365. On postgres.test)
