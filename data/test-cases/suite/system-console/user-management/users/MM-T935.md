## MM-T935: Users - System admin changes own password - Invalid new password

---

**Step 1**

1. Log in as system admin
2. Open System Console > Users
3. On own user, click drop-down and select Update password
4. Enter correct old password and an invalid new password (on Selenium server, it has fewer than the 5-character minimum)
5. Click Save

**Expected**

Error displays depending on how it was invalid, e.g. "_Your password must contain between 5 and 64 characters._"
