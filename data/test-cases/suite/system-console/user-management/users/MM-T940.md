## MM-T940: Users - Revoke all sessions

---

**Step 1**

1. Log on as test user (who you want to revoke sessions for), on multiple browsers / devices (at least 2 to 3 different sessions)\
   **Examples**: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android (RN or Classic); various browsers; desktop app

   - Mobile apps can have screen locked or not
   - Non-mobile can be with computer awake or asleep
   - Can log them in using any method (email/password, SAML, LDAP, OAuth)
   - Keep them visible, to watch for sessions ending

2. Logged in as system admin on another browser / device, go to System Console ➜ Users

3. Click on the 'Revoke All Sessions' button displayed at the bottom of the Users listing page.

4. A confirmation message should be displayed.

5. Click on Cancel in the message and check if no sessions are deactivated.

6. Click on the 'Revoke All Sessions' button again and confirm.

- [Cypress Automation: Revoke All Sessions — MM-17020](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-17020)

**Expected**

- Check if a confirmation message is displayed "This action revokes all sessions in the system. All users will be logged out from all devices. Are you sure you want to revoke all sessions?"
- When user clicks on Cancel button in the confirmation message, the existing user's session should still be active.
- All the users' session should be automatically logged out from all the browsers and devices when 'Revoke All Sessions' option was clicked in the confirmation message.
- Users should be redirected to login page and a message should be displayed in the login page 'Your session has expired. Please log in again.'
- Even the current system admin's session should also be deactivated and user should be redirected to the login page.
