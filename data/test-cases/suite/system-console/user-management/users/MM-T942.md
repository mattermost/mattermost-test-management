## MM-T942: Users - Deactivated user not in drop-down, auto-logged out

---

**Step 1**

1. Using drop-down menu to the right of the user's name, click to Deactivate and confirm
2. In a channel where the deactivated user had been a member, click the member icon

**Expected**

On 1,

- User is made inactive (logs user out automatically; try to log back in to confirm deactivated: "_Login failed because your account has been deactivated. Please contact an administrator._")
- Deactivated user does not show up in View Members for channels or teams (but does show up in DM More... menu so that DM channels can be viewed)

On 2, Deactivated user is not listed in the member list
