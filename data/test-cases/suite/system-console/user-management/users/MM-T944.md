## MM-T944: Users - Deactivate a user - Actively viewing DM in another window

---

**Step 1**

1. Open a DM with a user you want to deactivate, post a message
2. Open an additional tab or browser (logged in as same user) and go to System Console > Users
3. Position first browser so you can see LHS while working in System Console window
4. In System Console, find the user you want to deactivate > user drop-down > Deactivate
5. Observe DM in LHS in first browser

**Expected**

- DM channel immediately changes to archive icon in LHS
- Click over to first browser and verify message box in DM and also reply box in DM RHS are both replaced by message "_You are viewing an archived channel with a deactivated user._" so the DM is read-only
