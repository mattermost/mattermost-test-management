---

**Step 1**

1. Click on plus symbol menu at the top of the left hand side

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattermost/mattermost-test-management/main/data/asset/Plus_symbol_menu.png)

2. Click on 'Work Templates' in menu that drops down, observe work template modal appears

3. Select template from list on left side of modal

4. Mouse over the templates on the right

5. Click one of the templates

6. Observe that in the template, more information is revealed and the cursor changes to a hand to allow you to select it for use

   - The modal changes to reveal a preview of what is contained in that template

   - The Channels section at the top is already expanded and a screenshot example of what it will look like is on the right

   **Note:** Only Channels are included in every template

   - Below the Channels section will be ones for one or more of the following as not all 3 will be included with any given template:

     - Boards
     - Playbooks
     - Integrations

   - There is a back arrow at the top left corner

   - There are 'Back' and 'Next' buttons in the bottom right corner

7. Click each of the other sections in turn

8. Observe that:

   - Each section expands while closing the previously open section
   - Like the first section it displays a screenshot example on the right

9. Click either the back arrow or the 'Back' button to return to the template selection screen

10. Then click the 'Next' button to advance and observe:

    - An empty field is displayed to allow you to name the project
    - You're able to choose if the project will be public or private
    - There's a back arrow in the top left corner
    - There are 'Back' and 'Create' buttons in the bottom right corner

11. Type in a name for the project

12. Click the 'Create' button
