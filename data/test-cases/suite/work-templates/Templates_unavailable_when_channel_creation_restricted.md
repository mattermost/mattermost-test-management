**Objective**

This test is designed to ensure that we're covering the conditions that would NOT show the Work Templates menu item to regular users

**Precondition**

- A regular user has been created and is logged in on one browser while an admin is logged in using a different browser

---

**Step 1**

**All permissions granted:**

1. As the Admin, disable Public and Private channel creation for `All Members` located in `System Console ➜ User Management ➜ Permissions`
2. As the regular user, verify that the menu item to create from a template is **not** present in the onboarding task list or the ➕ menu at the top of the LHS

**Test Data**

**Expected**

- With both Public and Private channel creation disabled for regular users Work Templates are unavailable for them to use
