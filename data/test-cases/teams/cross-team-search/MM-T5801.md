## MM-T5801: Team Picker Drop-down UI/UX

---

**Step 1**

1\. Verify that a dropdown is available in the top-right corner to select teams.\
2\. Verify that the list in the dropdown contains all teams (no team should be missing).\
3\. Verify that there is no lazy loading for the dropdown (all teams should be preloaded).\
4\. Verify that the currently active team is selected by default when the dropdown is opened.\
5\. Verify that the team selection resets back to the currently active team upon reopening the dropdown.\
6\. Verify that the order of teams in the dropdown matches the team sidebar order.
