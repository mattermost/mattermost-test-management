## MM-T5801: Team Picker Drop-down UI/UX

---

**Step 1**

1. As a user with channel access, navigate to a channel that has an active ABAC policy
2. Click on the channel member count or use the channel menu to open the Channel Members right-hand sidebar (RHS)
3. Observe the list of channel members in the RHS
4. Verify that each user displays their relevant attribute tags next to their name/profile
5. Check users with different attribute values to ensure tags display correctly
6. Verify that users without attribute values show appropriate indication (no tags or default state)

**Expected**

- Channel Members RHS displays attribute tags for each user
- Tags accurately reflect the user's current attribute values
- Tags are clearly visible and properly formatted
- Users without attribute values display appropriately (no misleading tags)
- Tag display is consistent across all users in the member list
