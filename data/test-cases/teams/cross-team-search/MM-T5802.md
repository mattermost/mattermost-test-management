## MM-T5802: Team Picker Drop-down Autocomplete Functionality

---

**Step 1**

1\. Verify that when there are more than 5 teams, the dropdown has an input field that allows users to type and search.\
2\. Verify that typing in the input field filters the list of teams in real-time based on the typed text.\
3\. Verify that any team selected from the filtered dropdown comes to the top of the dropdown list.\
4\. Verify that clearing the input field resets the dropdown and displays the entire list of teams in the original sidebar order.
