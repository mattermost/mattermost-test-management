## MM-T5803: Team Picker Drop-down Functionality

---

**Step 1**

1\. Verify that selecting a team from the dropdown updates the search criteria to that selected team.\
2\. Verify that selecting "all teams" includes all available teams in the search scope.\
3\. Verify that single-team selection replaces any previous team filter (no multi-select).\
4\. Verify that selecting a team does not add any \`team:contributors\` text to the search input.\
5\. Verify that changing the selected team from the dropdown reinitiates the search immediately.
