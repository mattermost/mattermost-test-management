## MM-T5804: Channel Filter 'in:' Reset

---

**Step 1**

1\. Verify that if a user selects a channel in Team A, then switches to Team B, the \`in:\` filter is removed from the search input automatically.\
2\. Verify that a visual hint is displayed informing the user that the \`in:\` filter was removed.\
3\. Verify that the filter is retained if the user does not switch teams.
