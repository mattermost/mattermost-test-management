## MM-T5804: Channel Filter 'in:' Reset

---

**Step 1**

1. On mobile device, log in to Mattermost mobile app as a user with channel access
2. Navigate to a channel that has an active ABAC policy
3. Access the Members screen for the channel (via channel info, member count, or menu option)
4. Observe the list of channel members displayed on the mobile Members screen
5. Verify that each user displays their relevant attribute indicators/tags next to their name/profile
6. Check users with different attribute values to ensure indicators display correctly on mobile
7. Verify that users without attribute values show appropriate indication (no tags or default state)
8. Test on both portrait and landscape orientations if applicable
9. Scroll through the member list to ensure consistent display across all members

**Expected**

- Mobile Members screen displays attribute indicators for each user
- Indicators accurately reflect each user's current attribute values
- Indicators are clearly visible and properly formatted for mobile interface
- Display is optimized for mobile screen size and touch interaction
- Users without attribute values display appropriately (no misleading indicators)
- Indicator display is consistent across all users in the mobile member list
- Functionality works consistently across different mobile orientations
