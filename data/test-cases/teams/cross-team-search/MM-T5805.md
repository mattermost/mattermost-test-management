## MM-T5805: Edge Case Scenarios

---

**Step 1**

1. On mobile device, log in to Mattermost mobile app as a user with permission to add members to channels
2. Navigate to a channel that has an active ABAC policy
3. Access the Add Members screen for the channel (via channel menu, member management, or other entry point)
4. Observe the user search/selection interface on the mobile Add Members screen
5. Verify that each available user displays their relevant attribute indicators/tags next to their name/profile
6. Search for specific users and verify attribute indicators appear in mobile search results
7. Check users with different attribute values to ensure indicators display correctly on mobile
8. Verify that users without attribute values show appropriate indication (no tags or default state)
9. Test the selection process to ensure indicators remain visible during user selection
10. Test on both portrait and landscape orientations if applicable

**Expected**

- Mobile Add Members screen displays attribute indicators for each available user
- Indicators accurately reflect each user's current attribute values
- Indicators are clearly visible and properly formatted for mobile interface
- Search results maintain attribute indicator display on mobile
- Display is optimized for mobile screen size and touch interaction
- Users without attribute values display appropriately (no misleading indicators)
- Indicator display is consistent across all users in the mobile selection interface
- Selection process maintains indicator visibility and functionality
- Functionality works consistently across different mobile orientations
