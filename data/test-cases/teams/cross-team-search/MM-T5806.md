## MM-T5806: Cross-team Search UI - Dark Theme

---

**Step 1**

1. As system admin, navigate to Attribute-Based Access page in System Console
2. Click "Add policy" to create a new ABAC policy
3. Verify that the policy creation interface starts in Basic mode by default
4. In Basic mode, configure a simple policy using the dropdown selectors (Attribute, Operator, Value)
5. Switch to Advanced mode using the mode toggle/selector
6. Verify that the Basic mode configuration is preserved and translated into Advanced mode syntax
7. In Advanced mode, modify the policy using the advanced syntax editor
8. Switch back to Basic mode using the mode toggle/selector
9. Verify that the Advanced mode changes are preserved (if compatible with Basic mode) or appropriate handling occurs
10. Test switching multiple times between modes with different policy configurations

**Expected**

- Policy creation interface provides clear Basic and Advanced mode options
- Basic mode offers intuitive dropdown/form-based policy configuration
- Advanced mode provides syntax editor for complex policy creation
- Switching from Basic to Advanced preserves and translates the configuration correctly
- Switching from Advanced to Basic preserves compatible configurations
- Incompatible Advanced configurations are handled gracefully (with appropriate messaging)
- Mode switching is smooth and maintains user context
- Both modes produce functionally equivalent policies when using the same logic
- User can complete policy creation successfully in either mode
